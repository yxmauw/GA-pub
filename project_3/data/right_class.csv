1771,"Is John Stewart really the “most well known Green Lantern” like some people say he is? I’ve seen people say that John Stewart should have been the Lantern in the 2011 movie, since most people are “more familiar with him than Hal Jordan”.

I know that people who watched the DCAU Justice League cartoons are more familiar with John Stewart. But I’m a 2000s kid, and *my* first exposure to Green Lantern was Guy Gardner from Batman: The Brave And The Bold, with a few appearances from Hal. And what about the 80s and 90s kids who watched Super Friends and therefore are more familiar with Hal? Or the kids who watched the episode of Superman TAS that had Kyle Rayner as Green Lantern with Hal’s origin. 

I like John, but is he really so popular to the point that he’s the only one that general audiences would recognize in a movie?",0,0.31926829079019803,RF

But then WandaVision came out and it was just like *Poof!*  Gone, and gone it has stayed.  I've heard people try to argue that it wasn't a good accent to begin with, but we're talking about a made-up accent from a made-up European country.  How does anyone know that isn't just what a Sokovian person sounds like in English?  How do you judge the quality of a fake accent when the accent itself isn't real?

At first I thought it was only gone because they were in an American sitcom on the show, but then the show moved beyond the sitcom stuff and it just never came back.  No explanation, nothing.  If they wanted to get rid of it, they could've at least phased it out gradually, like she was improving her English over time or something, but instead they just gave it the axe without really addressing it.

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

I know that obviously Ammit is portrayed as the villain here so it seems to be ""correct"" to agree with Khonsu bu not neccesarily. Thanos is the villian in the infinity saga but there's discussion online about if what he did was the right thing as well, coz after all I've also heard of some fans saying that the best villians are those who actually believe that they are doing the right thing, especially so for Arthur Harrow.  


Khonsu: ""I only punish those who have chosen evil, I am real justice!""  
He waits for a crime to be committed before punishing them.  


But on the other hand if Ammit was allowed to rule, millions wouldn't have suffered from Hitler's war and genocide and like Harrow said, by the time Khonsu delivers their retribution, people have already suffered, but with Ammit there would be no war, no crime, the world would become an ideal world and I think everyone would be kind hearted? so that way it would seem to make Earth a paradise, not a bad option either.

928,"How do the comics square the concept of mutants with the world at large, vis a vis history and population numbers? I will preface this by saying that my knowledge of the finer bits of the X-men continuity is limited to the movies and some highlighted story beats.  The best explanation I currently have is as follows:  mutants have been around since humanity began (Apocalypse and his original 4 horsemen), but populations spiked (coincidentally) around nuclear bomb testing in the 60s (?) post WW2 (Magneto's whole history if it hasn't been changed).  The world saw an increasing population of scary and powerful people as a threat, several extermination plots were prevented as Professor X and his merry band of students and helpers tried to convince the world that mutant-kind was not a threat, while Magneto and his side tried to take things over with mutants as a superior race.  Phoenix force, yada yada, now mutants are immortal living on an isolated mutant-only island with the goal of protecting their own and being left alone (Hellfire gala subtitles seeming to say they are going to take a more active role in the world). Please correct me if I'm wrong.  

My main question is, if a not-insignificant portion of the world was mutant, that would be literally ALL THE WORLD WOULD CARRY ABOUT, so how big is the ""mutant problem"" compared to everything else going on in the Marvel universe? Forget the Avengers and Thor and aliens when your neighbor can teleport through walls and your mailman's son can shoot bone spurs from his elbows.

How large were mutant populations to justify genocide yet not be the sole focus of the universe? Is this just one of those things that gets brushed over as universes began to collide as comic book writers started crossing characters over, or is there a justification as to why Stark wasn't involved in anti-mutant military weapons, or why Captain America wasn't put on an anti-mutant detail one of the many times he was thawed out in the moving timeline?

1994,"My thoughts on what a shared DC Movie Universe could look like While I’ve enjoyed more of DC’s recent movie offerings, as a huge fan of DC, I still wish they could’ve built a more cohesive movie universe similar to the MCU. I just wanted to share my thoughts on how a film universe could’ve been done and wanted to see people’s thoughts on it.

 I’m just going to make a basic outline on a three phase approach, similar to the MCU’s Infinity Saga. Each phase would build to a Justice League movie that closes the phase out and the Justice League would be based off the classic team of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.

 
Phase 1:

This would obviously be the origin stories phase and each JL member would get their own solo movie. Now granted Superman and Batman could possibly be done without a straight-up origin story with as many solo movies as they’ve had and maybe just have quick flashbacks or references to their origins.

My only stipulation for each solo film for Phase 1 is that the heroes do not fight or come in contact with their arch enemies, which would come into play in the next phase. And possibly a couple of heroes could fight villains connected to Apokolips to have the presence of Darkseid ever looming in Phase 1. So maybe Superman could mainly be dealing with Intergang who have connections with Desaad and Kalibak or Wonder Woman could fight with Big Barda and the female furies (which could be a way to lead Big Barda down the superhero path).

The JL movie could be where the JL face off against Darkseid and while not full on defeating him, are at least able to stop him for this movie. I know a lot of people imagined Darkseid as a villain that caps off several phases similar to Thanos. I honestly feel he is a decent starting villain to bring the JL together that can always be brought back later as more powerful, plus the other JL villains I have in mind I feel can make the stakes much more personal as the movies progress.

 
Phase 2:

This is the phase where each hero would begin to be really challenged and face off against their arch enemies. So for instance Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex, Wonder Woman and Cheetah, Flash and Captain Cold, Green Lantern and Sinestro, Aquaman and Black Manta, and Martian Manhunter and Ma’alefa’ak.

Superman’s second movie with Lex could be the start to Phase 2. After Superman stops Lex in his own movie, Lex can come to the realization that stopping these heroes may require his own team. So he pops up at the end of each of the other movies recruiting the arch villains for each JL member.

This could also be a phase where other heroes are introduced to the world via each of the JL member’s solo movies or maybe having one or two new solo superhero movies, similar to Guardians and Ant-Man for the MCU’s phase 2, that way the world continues to expand and add new heroes. Maybe even in the Green Lantern movie you get an introduction to a new human, such as John Stewart, that will eventually become a Green Lantern.

Phase 2 would be capped off with a JL movie where, as already indicated, the JL fights against the Injustice League/Legion of Doom comprised of Lex, Joker, Cheetah, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Ma’alefa’ak. The story would be loosely based off Tower of Babel where the Injustice League learn of Batman’s secret plans he has created to take down each member of the JL in an emergency and they get a hold of them to take out each JL member. Maybe somewhere along the way Coast City gets destroyed which plays a part into Hal Jordan’s journey for phase 3. After the Injustice League is eventually defeated, the movie ends with the team feeling betrayed by Batman and removing him from the team due to his secret plans to take them out.

 
Phase 3:

This phase would focus on a theme of reflections where each JL member fights a villain that is essentially an evil reflection of them. The remaining JL members begin to see Batman’s point of view on plans that can be used to take them out if they went rogue, but at the same time Batman realizes in his own movie how he may have gone too far with his actions in secretly creating his plans.

For the movies, you could have Superman face off against Zod, Wonder Woman against Grail (which would also be a nice way to reference Darkseid again after three phases), Flash against Reverse Flash, Aquaman against Ocean Master, Green Lantern against Parallax, Batman against Prometheus, and Martian Manhunter against White Martian (not sure on this one completely).

In Flash’s movie, this could introduce the multiverse which will come into play in the third and fourth JL movies.

In the Green Lantern movie, Hal’s grief over Coast City’s destruction could lead to him being corrupted by Parallax, which is where John Stewart could step in as a new Green Lantern to help stop the threat and John Stewart gets inducted into the JL at the end after Hal takes a leave of absence once he is free from Parallax (or Hal possibly dies too in order to really raise the stakes in this universe by showing an actual league member dying).

In Batman’s movie, as he fights against Prometheus, he can see a corrupted version of himself in Prometheus and realize his mistakes with being so secretive about his plans. This Batman movie could also be the last one before the JL movie and Superman could possibly come in to help Batman, where they both make amends, and allows for at least one World’s Finest team up movie.

Again there may be other movies where new heroes are introduced in Phase 3 to continue to expand the universe.

Finally to close out Phase 3, there would be a two part JL movie which would focus on Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate. I imagine in the third movie, the JL members are approached by a good version of Lex from Earth 3 who asks for their help in overthrowing the Crime Syndicate. So the 6 JL members (with John Stewart being the new GL) take the fight to Earth 3. The JL would not win the first fight against the Crime Syndicate and the Crime Syndicate takes advantage of the knowledge of the existence of the JL’s Earth and go to conquer it. Of note, Batman may be mostly absent in this third JL movie to really get the feeling of at least one movie where Batman is off the team.

Then finally in the fourth JL movie, Batman finally makes amends with the remaining JL members after they have experienced what corrupted versions of themselves are like with the villains they faced in Phase 3 and after having just fought and lost to the Crime Syndicate. But Batman also admits his mistakes to the team too, possibly having also come across Owlman on his own in this movie too and learn even more what a corrupted version of him is like. The movie could end in an Endgame level fight of the JL vs Crime Syndicate on the JL’s Earth, along with the Crime Syndicate having brought over some evil versions of other heroes introduced in Phase 2 and 3 that could also all be involved in the fight.

This movie could end the three phase saga with the Justice League having finally expanded their membership and possibly a tease of a greater Crisis coming now that the multiverse has been introduced.",0,0.3245138590624581,RF

748,"This is a long shot, but I am looking for a very specific comic panel from a Spider-Man comic. Long story short, when I was a kid in the mid early to mid 2000's there I went to a library and there was a big black and white book of Spider-Man comics. From what I know about comics now this must have been a collection of reprints, given it was in black and white. I assume it has to be from The Amazing Spider-Man, *maybe* Spectacular Spider-Man, but I don't know much about if they made any big reprint books of those, especially in black and white. I assume it can't be Ultimate Spider-Man despite the popularity at the time given how new the series was, I very much doubt they had any black and white reprints of it then, if they even have them now.

So, I have given the backstory I can and my speculation, from my memory, this is what the actual panel was: 

I assume Spider-Man was sneaking around and spying on someone. I just remember he was probably on a wall spying on someone because the specific thing I remember is he said, **""Gloves don't leave finger prints""**. That is the only concrete thing I remember for sure, I think he may have been being accused of something, but that part could be completely wrong. 

This is why I said it is a long shot, I can't remember much other than the time period, **(mid-2000's)** and he said **""Gloves don't leave finger prints.""**

1500,"What Was The Fan Reaction To Tara Strong Taking Over As Harley Quinn In 2011 And Has Fan Opinion Changed On Her Since Then This is something I've been curious about for quite a while now. We can all agree that Arleen Sorkin will always be the definitive voice of Harley (as well as the inspiration for the characters creation).
But since she retired in 2011, Tara has pretty much become the defacto voice of Harley.
True other VAs have done Harley from Hynden Walch to Kaley Cuoco to Mellisa Rauch, etc and I do think they've done a good job but Tara's the one WB/DC have kept going back to for over a decade now.
I'm curious to know what people thought of her as Harley back when Arkham City came out and all the way up to today. Personally I do like her Harley (but maybe because I love Raven and her take on Batgirl in the DC Super Hero Girls series (the latter I loved so much I bought a replica of the hoodie she wears as Barbara Gordon) so maybe I admit some bias) but every so often I'll see someone claim she's terrible, that she makes Harley sound like a high pitched toddler, that she's kinda taken credit for the success of the character due to how often she's voiced Harley, etc.

843,"Help before Secret Wars comic (2015) Hello, I’m a marvel fan since I have memory. I pick up the comics of the characters that interest me and usually before an MCU debut of a character I didn’t know much about I read the essentials. I love 616 but I’ve never read Secret Wars 2015, I don’t know why but well, now I want to and I know it’s a big story so I’m gonna read some stuff before. I haven’t read absolutely every issue since the 60’s but pretty much there with Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Daredevil, X-Men, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Thor, Kamala Khan a lot of Avengers and West Coast, New Avengers etc. And many others I’m really familiar with. I’ve read a lot of 616 post Secret Wars with events and characters I love so I’m catch up I know about the world ending and rebooting but now I want to go back and read Secret Wars this cause as I said I don’t know why I haven’t done it yet and I want to experience the whole thing. Also read some of the preludes like in Ms Marvel last days. This is a list of events and issues that what I’ve come up with looking in the internet with different reading orders to catch up pre Secret Wars. Some of those I’ve already read but I want to have them fresh in my memory. I also plan on reading the Ultimate Universe before.

Basically I would really appreciate all your expertise Marvel fans of this sub to tell me if there are some more issues and events that I’ve missed that would improve my experience reading Secret Wars. It’s gonna be long but I hope it’s worth it. I would also appreciate if you told me which Secret Wars tie ins and BattleWorld issues are the best for you, when I read an event I usually only read the tie ins for the series I’m following, I’ve read everything for Civil War for example and it was too much. I’ve read the Thors one when I read Aaron’s Thor and liked it so if you guys tell me the best tie ins I’ll listen. Thank you! Have a good day if you don’t have suggestions. 


What I plan on reading is:

- Ultimate Universe
- Maybe reread 1602 if I have time 


-Earth 616:

-60’s Fantastic Four (essential issues ig)
-Secret Wars 1 (reread)
-Secret Wars 2
-Infinity Gauntlet/War/Crusade (reread)

-Invincible Iron Man (2006)
-Captain America (Brubaker)
-Secret War
-Civil War (reread)
-One More Day (reread)
-World War Hulk
-Secret Invasion 
-Dark Reign
-Siege (reread)
-Infinity (reread)
-Superior Iron Man 
-FF / Fantastic 4 (Hickman)
-Amazing Spider-Man 2014-2015
-The Incursions (avengers - new avengers)
-Time Runs Out

-Secret Wars 2015

- Tie Ins I’m gonna read (editing the post with your suggestions) : Spider-Man Renew your Vows, Thors (reread).



TL;DR: Give me suggestions before Secret Wars 2015 to enjoy the event more and also suggest your favorite Ti Ins and battleworld issues to read along with the event. Thanks!",1,0.8249267648391562,RF

Warning beforehand: I haven't read the comics, I looked over his wiki, and it encouraged me to write this.

The Scarlet Witch, while tearing through the Illuminati in a magic-child-induced rage, engaged in conversation with Mr. Fantastic (which shouldn'tve happened, and seemed out of character for her since she was already in that deep), who explained that black bolt could easily destroy her with a single word, which is completely true.

He, for some reason, flexes and smiles. LITERALLY WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?? That is so out of character for him! He literally never acts cocky any other time, even apologizing while killing alternate Dr. Strange!

Wanda asks, ""what mouth?"", revealing that she has removed his mouth from existence, which first of all was shocking and interesting, but then HE SCREAMS. This is what gets me. He understands the power of his ability, and never speaks any other time, even at emotional provocation, but just yells 'cause why not. 

Apparently, this man's face-skin or whatever is strong enough to REFLECT his vocal waves BACK into his head, through a YELL, which has LITERALLY RIPPED REALITY. WHAT???

But off-note, if  Warner Bros  make their own book division and turn DC  into a brand and is  part of their book division .Maybe, I think a hard reboot is needed for the DC universe, think about it whenever a comic book writer and artist becomes showrunner they will be in charge and give their reimagined take of  the DC universe and the characters with a beginning to end for few years , while the classics will live on as standalone stories .",0,0.3734592575189179,RF

I grew up watching those two shows, so many fantastic memories of my dad “sneaking” me out of my room after my bed time to watch it with him, and all the action figures I would get! Flash was my favorite in those days, and the only way my mom could get me to clean my room was to tell me “If you can do it fast enough, maybe you’ll even impress the flash!”

I hadn’t seen either show in years but I saw a clip a while back and hopped on HBO Max to watch them, and at this point I’ve rewatched both series about 3 times in the past few months. After going back I can really appreciate the approach to storytelling and narrative with it as well, the writing is phenomenal, and I can’t explain how much I love the “Hereafter” arc! I think these shows are deserving of the utmost praise, and if they’re not already praised, they’re criminally underrated!

1784,"DC Infinite App (iOS) - Can someone help, or am I just being really stupid? Hi folks

Sorry to ask this, at the risk of seeming dumb, but the app feels really unintuitive to use in certain ways and so I was hoping someone could help.

I'm trying to read collected storylines from their own suggested storylines, but I'm having a problem with getting the comics to keep loading in reading order.

For instance, if there's a storyline which spans over multiple series, let's say for simplicity the story order is;

Batman 1, Batman 2, JLA 1, Batman 3, JLA 2, Robin 1, Batman 4

when I select the storyline in question, it shows all the various books initially, but when I start to read, I'll get through Batman 1 and 2 ok, but when I hit ""read next"" from Batman 2, it jumps right to Batman 3, rather than JLA 1, if that makes sense?

Is there a way to do this that actually follows the reading order when hitting ""read next"" rather than the issue order of the current series?

77,"My Problem With Everyone Making Fun of Mr. Fantastic Now as we all know the movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness recently came out and if you don't know that, have you been living under a rock and I'm being serious with that question?

Anyway I digress, in the movie Mr. Fantastic tells Wanda, Black Bolt's only power that being his voice in which Wanda simply removes the hole in Black Bolt's face containing his mouth. Black Bolt freaks out and blows his own brains out but with a sound instead of a gun, Mr. Fantastic horrified by what Wanda did freaks out and tries to grab Wanda but she simply shreds him and turns him into cottage cheese.

Now as most people know Mr. Fantastic has been getting ""memeed on"" so to speak with there being memes calling him the dumbest man in the world or saying that he forgot that he is the smartest man alive. At first I didn't mind these memes as I thought that everyone was right and Mr. Fantastic made a dumb decision, which I'm not saying didn't make ***A*** dumb decision meaning one but I'm saying that the decision to tell Wanda about Black Bolt was only semi-dumb. You see for those of you who weren't really paying attention to the situation and just wanted a fight, Mr. Fantastic thought he could simply intimidate Wanda into surrendering. Being that he found Strange to be more dangerous than Wanda he though Wanda would be a walk in the park compared to Strange. So as an intimidation attempt he told Wanda what Black Bolt could do to Wanda, as we all know Wanda was not at all intimidated and took away Black Bolt's face hole making him blow up from the inside out.

Now where Mr. Fantastic makes the dumb decision is in what he does next, instead of being calm about the situation he freaks out and you can see it in his face as soon as Black Bolt dies. Reed looks like he just lost not only his best friend (which he did), but his most powerful ally (which he kind of did I mean Captain Marvel wasn't much help) and so decides he can maybe restrain Wanda but she sees it coming and kills him. Also I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared or sad when your friend is brutally murdered in front of you but I'm saying if you have bigger fish to fry (metaphorically speaking) then you should fry the fish then mourn. Also just because your the smartest man alive doesn't mean you don't sometimes make dumb decisions or just not have feelings, and remember feelings make us all act dumb sometimes.

Anyway I'm glad I got that out of the way.",1,0.6450000861519848,RF

She also cheated on him with freakin Bruce and got mad at him for being non consensually kissed by Tarantula and broke up with him for it.

Now onto him, they are willing to destroy essential parts of him just to have him with her, having him cheat on Kory before their wedding (even though I’m like 90% sure he was still under brother Bloods control) they also have a habit of making his skills less to make her look good.

Yeah, the second half of this movie was totally Sam Raimi and it was dope af. Liz Olsen nearly steals the show, she was absolutely fucking good af and is easily the best she was in the whole MCU. Strange, he was..I'd say as good as he always has been. Liz actually did surpass him, but that's not a knock on Benedict by any means, he was the second best as far as leads go.

I feel like this movie could have been a little bit better, like if the first half was just as good as the second half as far as the tone goes, but it was still pretty damn solid overall

I also found it pretty cool to see Stewart as Charles and John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic! Now I do not know if Charles will return in the future, given Wanda broke his neck and a small guess is that was just a throwaway fan service moment, but Krasinski for sure will reprise Mr. Fantastic, given a F4 reboot is on the way.

1028,"What is your favorite and least favorite adaptational origin change? Every superhero adaptation takes liberties, and origins are a common thing to change for better or worse. On this thread, list what adaptational origin you liked best, and which one you hated most of all. And why one worked and why the other did not.

Both of mine involved then hero's parent not being whom they thought they were. 

Best: Batman the Telltale Game. In this episodic game retelling of  Batman's early career, Bruce Wayne learns a horrifying secret about his family. Thomas and Martha Wayne, had ties to the mob and worked with Carmine Falcone and Hamilton Hill. Wayne Enterprises was also a greedy  and amoral corporation that did all the terrible things that real world  corporations do to people and the planet. One day however, Thomas went too far and Martha(who had at least a little bit more standards)  threatened to leave him and take Bruce with her. Thomas soon began to  start thinking about leaving crime behind. But when Mayor Hill found out  about this, he feared Thomas would become a security risk, and hired a  thug named Joe Chill to murder him.

There are a number of reasons why this works for me. The first is because this change allows Batman to keep going strong in the changing world today, as our views of the rich are not as glamorous as they used to be. This also shows how Bruce was never corrupted by the power and wealth he was born into. This also serves as a catalyst of why he is Batman. Because some of the members of his rogues gallery in this continuity, became villains because of Thomas Wayne. So Bruce sees being Batman as correcting his fathers crimes. And finally, this solves a minor issue I have with Batman's origin. Thomas and Martha Wayne were two of the most respected and loved citizens of Gotham. If they were killed in a mugging, it would be all over the news and the murderer would have nowhere to run. But if Chill was a paid hitman who had friends in the Mob, they could protect him when the cops would come looking for him. And it shows gamers and audiences what kind of corruption plagues the world of the elite.

Now for my most hated origin change. Shazam 2019. I once never thought one slip-up could ruin a whole movie. This movie proved me wrong. When Billy Batson finally meets his biological mother, he finds out that she abandoned him due to being unwilling to care for him, and as punishment, she now lives in a poor apartment, with a minimum wage job, and abusive boyfriend. She also reveals that she was kicked out of home due to a teen pregnancy and her boyfriend was incarcerated. She also shows no love for the boy. The whole reason this scene exists, is so that Billy will accept his adoptive family as his real one. And they did a terrible job of doing it.

Why this does not work? Where to begin? I know what she did was wrong, but what Billy doesn't get, and what the movie does not show, was that both he and his mother were screwed over by the system that the Telltale Thomas Wayne ran. Homelessness is caused by things like poverty, long term unemployment, desperation, bias against the homeless, and even disasters, all of which are caused by capitalism. I don't think she would have abandoned him had she not been screwed over. There's a much greater evil at work in that scene, but the movie and Billy refused to show or see it, and the narrative does something that capitalism does, blame poverty, hardship, and misery on the poor and downtrodden. I would have expected a poor orphan like Billy Batson to know what it's like to live under an unfair system that can make people desperate enough to do terrible things, given that he's supposed to be even kinder then Superman. While I initially applauded the movie for it's themes of there is no such thing as pure of heart, maybe it needed Billy to be pure of heart. And it served no purpose apart from appreciating his adopted family. There are much better ways to show it, but that's all it does. It doesn't serve as a catalyst him to be a better hero, and it shifts the blame from a fixed system to a victim of it. And by doing that, it does the audience no favors. Not to mention that with Roe V Wade overturned, this hurts a lot more.

It would be an open-world game where you can explore New York. The game would feature Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor as the main/starter characters. Eventually, more people such as Black Panther and Ant-Man would be added. You'd be able to switch between all 6 members at any time and the ones not used will occasionally attack an enemy.  Like Insomniac's Spider-Man, there would be the missions tab on the menu which would be used to play missions to play out the hero's origins. There would be an equipment system in the game and it would change the appearance. However, you'd be able to switch to a cosmetics tab that would let you choose armors you have to apply for the look only and change the color schemes of each item or the entire armor, like in Destiny 2.  Iron Man would work differently than this, where he would have the equipment system still, but his would not only buff it but they would be parts of different armors and marks that would be weaker if it's not in the full set. You'd be able to switch into different avengers by using a system like Insomniac's Spider-Man where you hold a button, time slows, and you can choose a character through a menu. It'd also feature an event system, where after the campaign, there would be events where there would be boss battles or big fights, such as a Chitauri invasion or a Black Order battle.",1,0.7348044708559648,RF

235,"Honestly I think it’s boring when Peter Parker is a broke college student and life as Spider-Man sucks. The title says it all. Im just tired of Peter being broke and life just sucks all around for him. I think it’s boring that his character never seems to get anywhere. Anytime it looks like his life is heading in the right direction and is moving forward the writers just completely back track his story because him being married to the girl of his dreams and having a family without the constant worry of money problems isn’t relatable to the readers. Like what about the long time readers/fans who have stuck around with Spider-Man and his story and have achieved that goal in life and want the same happiness for a character they hold dear. I just want to see Peter happy, thats all.

While I was watching the movie, something grabbed my attention. Where is Infinity?

In case you didn’t realise, the Marvel Comics multiverse is the 7th generation (now 8th), and it is embodied by two figures: Eternity (the embodiment of Time) and Infinity (the embodiment of Space).

Each universe has a smaller version of these beings, and this is what we see in Thor L&amp;T.

The MCU (Universal not Multiversal) embodiment of Time; Eternity. 

But where is Infinity? She’s meant to be alongside Eternity, but at the centre of the universe (in the hall and on Eternity’s spiritual plane) she’s nowhere to be found.

Enter: Love

Love is a new character (she isn’t in the comics) so Taika must be doing something new.

She is born from Eternity (and seems to possess his powers. Not to mention she‘s a girl (just like Infinity is depicted).

But here’s the clincher: When Love is revived by Eternity we see her reflection in the water. A female version of Eternity; Infinity.

301,"I'm a huge MCU fan, but... Thor: Love and Thunder is the worst MCU film of all time. It's worse than Dark World. It's an objectively bad movie. The dialogue was horrible, the acting was terrible (Even Christian Bale had some really bad moments, though Gor was a pretty good villain). The writing was the worst. It tried to crank the silly factor of Ragnarok up tenfold and just succeeded in pure absurdity.

Don't let the media claim this is a sign that Superhero films are dead. I've loved every other Marvel movie, even Eternals and Incredible Hulk. I liked Dark World, though it was one of the weakest. I defend the MCU every time someone bad mouths it. But I can't defend this steaming pile of crap. It's just a bad movie. I almost walked out, but I convinced myself it would get better (and it did, just before the end - a little). If you can wait a couple months and have Disney+, wait for it there.

1970,"Chris Jones and Greg Weisman answer fan questions on DCUI Forums to celebrate the release of Young Justice: Targets &amp;#x200B;

    Q1: will we see the Penguin on Young Justice? I’m a huge fan of the character and would love to see him on the show.:smiley:

GW: I’m afraid my answer to this - as to most of these kinds of questions - is NO SPOILERS. But we did MENTION Penguin in Phantoms. So at least you know an Earth-16 version of ol’ Oswald exists. 

    Q2: Who will be in the team? Will Greta Hayes be in it — asking for a friend :eyes:

GW: Targets takes place only a month after Phantoms! The roster of the Team will not have changed. 

    Q3: I was curious if this was an idea that got left out of the current season or a new idea that came about after the season was written. I love this show and hope for another season or at least more comic series.

GW: These are ideas which Brandon Vietti and I have had for some time…We’re finally getting around to “portraying” them in Targets. 

    Q4: I love that characters that first appeared in the original YJ tie-in comic series a decade ago like Wyynde, King Sha’ark, Blubber got to eventually show up in animation in YJ Seasons 3 and 4.
    
    Is YJ: Targets introducing any new characters that Chris got to design/draw that we may see again down the line in the animated series?

GW: YES!

CJ: Obviously that would be dependent on their being future seasons to appear in (#SaveEarth16), but we’ve already had characters from the previous tie-in comics make their way into the TV show, so it could certainly happen again! 

    Q5: Hey Greg and Chris, thanks for coming back! That was a really phenomenal season finale we just watched. I’ve got one question though – how were Zod and the other Phantom Zoners instantly able to address Metropolis in English when they emerged from the Boom Tube? Thanks!

GW: Ma’alefa’ak downloaded English to their minds!

    Q6: From what I’ve read online, it appears that each story will have a back up story as well. Will the backup be solo adventures of our heroes or villains from the past or team adventures filling in some gaps from the TV show, and was their a Young Justice character, you wanted to include more of but just didn’t have the space to do so.

GW: There are always characters that we want to devote more screen or page time to. Always. As for the back-ups, the first one focuses on Red Arrow. As for the other five… wait and see! 

    Q7: I don’t see the point in putting a question when mine never get asked but whatever. In hopefully future seasons, will you be continuing to focus on the OG Team?

GW: If you don’t ask, you can’t get an answer! :wink: We’ll always pay attention to the so-called OGs. But each season is intentionally different from past seasons. But the best way to show growth in the characters is to have earlier seasons’ versions of those characters to compare them to. 

    Q8: My question is I’m curious to why Vandal Savage was chosen as the big bad or an important one at least and will his plan continues to grow in these comics?

GW: Vandal’s historic history, going back 50K years made the idea of putting him up against young heroes extremely appealing to Brandon Vietti and myself. But that doesn’t guarantee that he’s involved with EVERY story. So I’m not going to reveal whether he is or isn’t involved in Targets. No spoilers! 

    Q9: I’m a bit confused on the timeline, which might just be because I’m stupid, but is the child that Ursa is pregnant with in the season finale supposed to be, genetically at least, a version of Lor-Zod? Or did the present day Ursa already give birth to Lor?

GW: The former, if I’m reading your question correctly. 

    Q10: When will you two work on the next Gargoyles?

CJ: Look closely at the pages of the second issue of YJ Targets for the answer to your question…

GW: There’s an Easter egg there just waiting to hatch… 

    Q11: Hi Greg and Chris!! I absolutely loved the finale of S4 and all the episodes and how we got to see the original team again. Will the YJ Targets series introduce any new characters that we have not seen before and will some team members have new outfits and or designs?

CJ: It’s been only a short time since the conclusion of Young Justice Season 4, so the designs and outfits are pretty much unchanged since Phantoms, but you ABSOLUTELY WILL be seeing some new characters in upcoming issues.

    Q12: what made you decide to give Conner only some of his power from the comic in this series.

GW: We wanted to go with 1938 Superman powers. Powers that were simply an extension and expansion of what a human could do. So Infrared vision, as opposed to heat vision. Super-leaping instead of flying, etc.

    Q13: What was it like voicing Lucas Carr and being the one marrying Miss M and SB? After all this time, did you feel something special when you finished recording the dialogue that closed up what was opened back in pretty much episode 2?

GW: It felt like the culmination of a decade’s worth of work, honestly. You can hear Lucas choke up, and truthfully, I choke up every time I watch that wedding, especially the vows. (And, yeah, I know that sounds immodest, since I wrote them, but all credit to Danica and Nolan for voicing them with so much sincere feeling!)

    Q14: I know you said numerous times there will never be a definitive ending to Young Justice, that you only do open-ended closure.
    But i have to know do you have a ending for the Darkseid Saga planned? Because i feel like it’s leading up to be essentially your Infinity Saga.

GW: We have plans for where we’re going for most of our storylines. But Darseid Is… 

    Q15: I absolutely loved the season 4 finale. I have a nitpick-y question regarding the wedding scene. Conner mentioned that everyone there was “in the know,” so I’m curious about how Wendy Harris and Harper &amp; Cullen Row found out (as in, who told them and when)? Thank you so much for your time and another wonderful season! Can’t wait to read Targets!

GW: Harper and Cullen were filled in when they moved in with foster parents Lucas and Bethany. Wendy figured it out. I’m not going to go into any more detail than that, because we might want to SHOW those scenes some day.

    Q16: How does it feel to see some of the characters you designed for the comic tie-in (Sha’lain’a, King Sha’ark, Wyynde, etc.) make the jump to the series in seasons 3 and 4?

CJ: It was amazing getting to see characters we introduced (the YJ versions at least) in the comic make their way into the TV show. With the characters from the Atlantis arc especially, those characters had to be aged up in adapting them for the TV show, and I got to help update the design for Ronal specifically! I’d love to see more “cross-pollination” between the TV show and comic if they both continue!

    Q17: With such a talented voice cast with the likes of Jessie McCartney, Troy Baker, Tara Strong, and more on the show, have you guys ever considered doing a musical episode for YJ, and do you think it is still in the cards for the future?

GW: We always include at least one song per season. And Chris and Kristopher Carter and I produced a YJ RadioPlay at CONvergence convention one year that was a full-on musical. ([You can find it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ9Q4LJ3Lbk)) As for doing an actual musical episode of the show, I’d be game, but Brandon Vietti and I would have to find a valid reason - beyond just “Hey, wouldn’t this be fun (though a pain) to produce!” to make it actually fit into our fairly realistic Earth-16. 

    Q18: How much of the original 5-season plan is still intact?

GW: All of it, really. Keep in mind that plan was broad strokes. It wasn’t about little details. So we didn’t tweak anything on that broad strokes level based on the long hiatus.

    Q19: Will you guys be appearing in Comic Conventions in the East Coast this year?
    
    …and if you were given green light to do as you please within DC comics, how many more comics would you two put out right after Targets? How many more story arcs you already have in mind with these amazing characters in this amazing Earth 16?

GW: Personally, I haven’t been invited to any upcoming conventions anywhere, so… nope, I won’t be appearing. And I’d be willing to do as many comics as DC’ll let us do. REALLY, TRULY not worried about running out of stories.

CJ: I’m hoping to get to New York Comic Con this year. Between the pandemic and my schedule since moving to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers Animation I haven’t been able to get to a convention in a couple of years and I really miss getting to see fans!

And I’d always be down for more Young Justice comics if I could fit them into my schedule. I love these characters and never tire of helping tell their stories.

    Q20: Why did you make Hal suddenly look solder than his peers in YJ? He is actually younger than Bruce or Clark in comics.

GW: On Earth-16, Hal is actually a tad older than Clark and Bruce. But, really, the decision to have him be a bit gray at the temples was the choice of our original lead character designer and 3rd Season Art Director, Phil Bourassa. He suggested it, and Brandon Vietti and I said, sure.

    Q21: How long do you intend to keep teasing the return of Jason Todd?

GW: Who says he’s returning? :wink:

    Q22: Will we get to see more of wonder girl as she the leader of the outsiders ?!

GW: Yes. In Young Justice: Targets! Keep reading!

    Q23: Greg Weisman, will there be a sequel to Catwoman: Hunted?

GW: I have no idea, but I hope so. It was designed to be the first story in a trilogy of tales. We’ll just have to wait and see…

    Q24: Also, just wanna thank you for the representation of people with autism. I have it myself and I appreciate the whole arc about Rocket coming to understand her son through seeing Orion and how you acknowledge both the experiences of the autistic person himself and those of loved ones like parents. Man, I could go on and on and on about it lmao. Also just love all the representation in general. :00_dc_pride: :00_dc_pride_ps: :heart:

GW: Thanks. We’re always trying to increase the show’s representation on multiple fronts. We know how important it is to our fans. It’s important to us, as well.

    Q25: How is the process different when writing/drawing for the comics versus working on the show?

CJ: There’s a lot of overlap - it’s still drawing superheroes and visual storytelling. But instead of planning for movement in a static frame, you’re creating sequential art and having to figure out how to fit everything onto a page and allow room for dialog and make sure that the composition leads the eye across all the elements of the page in the correct order…there are a lot of differences!

GW: It’s not really all that different for me. It’s just about striving to tell stories in shorter chunks. A standard-length comic book issue is about the equivalent of 1/3 of an animated episode. And each page of a comic book needs to tell a mini-story of it’s own. Beyond that, I also need to keep in mind that I won’t have my voice cast to fall back upon, etc. And no ACTUAL movement, just the implication of movement. So I just have to remind myself to cover my bases differently.

    Q26: any new characters from this season going to be regulars in the next season? i liked megans family. they were fun to watch. hopefully more martians in season 5.

GW: No spoilers. (Assuming we get a next season.)

    Q27: will we see redhood in the series as we knew he died around season 2 it would be nice to see him.

GW: Who says you haven’t seen him? :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

CJ: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for supporting the show and the comic. We’d very much love to do more if there’s enough support for it!

GW: Out of time. But thanks for asking your questions. Hope you enjoyed the answers. Meanwhile, #KeepBingingYJ and READ #YoungJusticeTargets to help us #SaveEarth16!",0,0.3795386051062152,RF

Specifically with Kamala they Americanize it, even when native speakers are saying it. As if they are forcing native speakers to mispronounce it.

They make it a point to pronounce all the other brown names/words without the English accent. 

To their credit they seem to get the accents both when brown people are saying english words, and when native english speakers are saying sanskrit/urdu/hindi origin words. And even capture some of the code switching that happens between school and home.

When Peter first approaches Dr Strange for help, they opt for a spell which will make everyone forget that he’s Spider-Man. They’ll still know Peter, just not that he’s a superhero. However at the end the spell is different - this time they’re wiping all memories of him completely, resulting in a rather sad ending.

2- After some journey of self-discovery gets a new identity after he sees he can be a hero and doesn’t need the image of Batman to save people’s lives

3- he dies as Batman and is remembered as a hero odds are he’ll  come back to life at one point in the future because comics

525,"IM TIRED OF THIS I’m tired of the spoiler culture surrounding the MCU. It seems like ever since No way Home we’ve been obsessed with spoiling all the movies as soon as they come out. Even then this has been an issue since around the time Infinity War and Endgame came out but at least the side movies during that time were usually fine for you to see a week or two later without being spoiled. Now it’s every movie. I will have to go see Thor: Love and Thunder opening night so that I don’t risk it being spoiled and even then THE PLOT LEAKED SO I GUESS ITS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE. This idea that the 4th installment in a franchise that’s an action, comedy, adventure movie could be spoiled because people don’t keep their mouths shut is mind boggling! Maybe it’s just me but it would have been great not to know the cameos in Multiverse of Madness or No Way Home! Or even the show Hawkeye!

22,"MCU heroes ranked by wealth I will forget a few, and I'm assuming Endgame doesn't give someone perfect connections since most of those characters barely talked. Even the all girl ""I'm with you"" moment lead to precisely zero relationships being built.

Also I'm using Kingo in the Eternals because he's the one with the clearest socio-economic status.

**Richer than some countries**

Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther

**Multiple mansions or other tremendously valuable things**

Kingo, Ms. Marvel

**Vaguely upper class**

Hawkeye, Dr. Strange

**Has a job and a house but it's unimpressive**

Ant Man, Spider Man, Shang Chi, 

**Homeless, but they know people**

Hulk, Captain America, Loki, Black Widow, Captain Marvel,  

**Homeless and crap connections**

Guardians of the Galaxy 

&amp;#x200B;

**My take on the most impractical**

**Captain America**

Many members of the US military wind up underpaid on the street. Captain America happens to be a celebrity from a bygone era who came back to save the world more than once. He's a rare case where he's actually a veteran of more than 4 wars, so the dude definitely deserves some government subsidies.

**Ms Marvel**

Her grandmother, a single woman, became a refugee in Pakistan, where she was able to work her way up in society to the highest levels and afford a massive mansion. Then her daughter, an immigrant, came to America and managed to get a swanky, rather large two floor house in the Jersey City suburbs back in like the 1980's.

**Tony Stark**

He was a public figure war profiteer who went on to bash his entire industry, and spend his fortune on himself, buying fancy houses and making high tech suits of armor. The last time he actually sells something is in Iron Man 1, at the very beginning of the film, and somehow over the course of the movies, he keeps getting richer.",1,0.7862003196574233,RF

The reason why Mjöllnir choose Jane as the new Thor in the comics , is that Thor became unworthy, but in the MCU Thor is still worthy and I doubt that the comics unworthy Thor storyline is going to happen in LOVE and Thunder.

After failing in Infinity War , Thor felt unworthy , let himself go, and became a little weird , And he gone on a crazy adventure to find peace.

During the time high Thor got a pep talk from his mom, allowing him to achieve his redemption arc, and him being able to summon Mjöllnir made him feel worthy again.

Which was a type of validation. It was a sign of his failures are forgiven and now he can forge a new path for himself and remember that Ragnarok was about the understanding that he's not defined by his hammer .

**But Who's Jane From Thor Love And Thunder ?**

Remember , Jane is a very smart woman. She's a leading astrophysicist and astronomer, and she's an expert on all things related to Asgard.

She is the first human mortal who probably ever set foot on the ground of Asgard. All of those things are the reason why [she received a Nobel Prize](https://www.hotseatmag.com/article/how-jane-fixes-the-hammer-and-becomes-worthy-in-thor-love-and-thunder).

\- In Superman: The Secret Years (1985) he transitions from Superboy to Superman, during college.  


So my question is, do all of the Legion adventures happen before his 16th birthday, or is the New Adventures of Superboy (I haven't read it yet) modern retellings of stuff from Volume 1? Has anyone put together a Superboy chronology that might include Adventure Comics?

I have it given too much thought but I would’ve loved to have seen a version that’s set back when they first debuted and make it a semi period piece. My other suggestion is that in keeping with the 616 reality, the film opens with the fantastic four already stranded in the negative zone, time works different there, while the four went missing years ago and presumed dead for them only a short period of time has passed, they find a way out but they inadvertently bring a big bad with them to earth like a galactus or Annihilus, as I said I’m not too familiar with them (or their villains), and I do kinda feel like I’m forgetting doctor doom though…",1,0.5393283695433704,RF
612,"Marvel multiverse concept gives off the same energy as disney live action remakes I haven't watched MUM yet but the entire idea seems like a lazy concept. They did it once with Spiderman and  I thought it was okay but bringing back old actors over and over again just seems like a cheap shot at prying for the audience's nostalgia. Again, I haven't watched dr. strange yet so maybe it's actually good and I'm being cynical but if they do another multiverse movie then it's just giving Disney live-action remakes. 

Also, I feel like they put in so much effort trying to make endgame an epic last hurrah by going all out and killing a bunch of avengers but after throwing away 110% of their material they don't know what to do now hence the (IMO) lazy ideas for new movies. I mean how convenient is it for them to get rid of a bunch of characters and put their stories to rest but now they have this whole new universe where none of that actually happened so they could do it all over again. 

Also, this was written at 3 am after i heard smth of Hugh Jackman coming back as logan in the multiverse and chris evans coming back as human torch and the new young avengers era so if this makes no sense and the English is shitty blame it on sleep deprivation (I'll be taking no accountability but also if u wanna have aggressive discussions in the comments I support that too).",1,0.6156298949752312,RF

Future Sinister learns something past Sinister needs to know. He uploads the info to a Moira clone, kills a Moira clone, and then Sinister activates the X-gene from a baby Moira (or several?) to get the info, Sinister downloads it, and he knows what happens in the future. 

So, my questions are as follows:

1) Are these future Sinisters done when the Moira clone dies? Does the timeline essentially collapse and end with her death, or it is essentially like Sinister claps his hands and says ""I know that'll come in handy for past me!"" and keep going?

2) If he is getting information from future timelines that end once Moira dies, wouldn't he receive all the information immediately once he first set up this game of Moira Telephone?

Among the headcanons I'm writing I thought of the crazy idea of turning a meme like Bully Maguire into a character, someone with an actual role. At this point I don't know how big his involvement will be but the premise I came up with for him involves him being a villain in a multiverse crossover I'm planning. Since the stories are in development they're not meant to be elaborate yet. Basically the meme known as Bully Maguire in this is just an alternate version of the 2002 Sony universe Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) whom in this alternate universe, during the third movie's events chose to embrace the violent and aggressive nature given to him by Venom and in the future uses his genius to become a successful industrialist, but over the course of several years he finds a planet where symbiotes live peacefully but uses the tech he develops to control them with a hive mind (kind of like Tony Stark but with aliens instead of armors), and somehow in a strange twist of events he becomes an evil warlord who kills any superhero in his universe and tries to use his hive controlled symbiotes to rule the world, typical villain goals. But instead of having a cause he just does it cause he can, like the personality we saw in the meme he acts humorous, has a big ego, banters and taunts his enemies, and a characteristic is that he never masks cause his face symbolizes fear to his enemies (or something like that, Bully Maguire never masks). This is just a premise basically, his involvement in my story isn't that deep outside of one confrontation with the main characters but I actually want him to have a fight with Scarlet Witch at some point.

1779,"Would it make sense to say that Superman has been reduced to a simple hero with godly abilities and not focused on the ideals that he represents, while Batman is continuously glorified as a perfect being in every way without focusing on his flawed humanity? The DC heroes are most well-known for their iconography and what they are meant to represent.

The Superman icon, the original hero, is a representation of a person who has so many abilities, almost like that of a god (sometimes when more powerful than what he usually is in the main DC storyline like Superman Prime) but chose to reduce himself to our level, we humans, because he believes that he does is the right thing.

There are obvious similarities here with Christianity and American idealism.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end, the iconography of Superman is the representation of genuine and just protection from any harm. In short, he is truly meant to be an icon of hope, justice and the American way even if he is a classic hero.

However, I feel that the iconography of Superman has been changed into just simply portraying him as perfect but he is never focused on what he represents even if he is considered as boring because in the end, he is meant to give a feeling of hope that everyone he encounters, no matter how hard their day was or what the person was going through.

We tend to see Superman being portrayed in a manner where we are provoked to question his principles and actions as someone with all that power, a God amongst us humans, may be provoked to think otherwise that he would deem as just - such as in The Dark Knight Returns storyline, in the Red Sun comic and in the Injustice arc.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, Batman is almost an anti-hero version of Superman where his idea of justice is more blurry as he can sometimes jump between vengeance and justice, or between going by the book or vigilantism or a necessary evil.

However, it seems that Batman, being the most popular superhero, is implemented in almost every storyline possible, even in stories where he is out of place such as in the Justice League Dark film, and where he is portrayed as a person who is almost perfect and just in every way, almost like a super-righteous knight.

The most common example that comes to mind is how Batman seems to have been ""fanboy""-ied into being the kind of hero that can anyone with preparation and resources, no matter how powerful or smart or numerous his opponents are.

Or that no matter what Batman thinks or does, no matter how dark his thoughts may be or how brutal or shocking his methods are, he is considered as always the right and the hero of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

However, being that Batman is meant to be a human being who has limits in terms of power when compared to meta beings, he is meant to represent to flaw nature of humanity - our way of thinking, and our way of life, as Batman was raised in human culture and is most familiar with the shockingly brutal reality of Gotham and Arkham.

But even though Batman is meant to be a human being and even if he is identified as a genius and implements logic in his methods and principles such as in his ""no-killing"" rule and is very aware of himself, I do not think that we often see Batman being placed in positions where he is provoked to question my morals, principles or even his sanity considering how blurry and conveniently human they are (at least, not in mainstream media).

We managed to have storylines where Batman was provoked to be in this position a couple of times such as in the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, in the Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth story, in the Long Halloween storyline, or in The Joker: Devil's Advocate story, or one instance in the Killing Joke, 

But it seems that every time the Dark Knight is portrayed, at least in most mainstream media, Batman is worshipped in almost every way and that no matter what his actions and ideas are, he is always the hero - in the Lego Batman film is where we find this most prominently where his hero worship was used as the main driving humour of the story.

It is as though Batman is impervious to criticism and he is always the hero in the end - no matter if he was the extreme rebel in the Red Son story, or the brutal and narcissistic person in the All-Star storyline and in the Dark Knight Returns, or how thorough and defensive he was in the Tower of Babel story where he made contingency plans for every Justice League member without their knowledge, or no matter what parenting style he uses to the Robin family (usually done in a very disciplinary manner which the Red Hood sometimes uses as an excuse for his anger towards Batman)

&amp;#x200B;

It feels ironic that these beings are portrayed in almost opposite ways than what they are meant to be where Batman is meant human at his core and being human means being flawed, while Superman is meant to be perfect but meant to be a representation of an ideal despite his almost omnipotent existence",0,0.2986329464078106,RF

993,"Unpopular opinion: I wish Marvel deaths were permanent Well, okay, let me elaborate: I wish character deaths in Marvel Comics were permanent *for the most part.* I mean, yeah, in a few cases it makes sense for the character to come back, I get it. But a lot of the best storylines involve a main character dying — Death of Spider-Man, Dark Phoenix Saga, Death of Captain Marvel, The Night Gwen Stacy Died, and many others included. All of those stories I listed involve someone (Ultimate Spider-Man, Jean Grey, Mar-Vell the original Captain Marvel, Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn) being killed for real. The only characters that came back were Jean and Norman, and they came back after *at least* a couple decades.

No, this is not me saying that I wish Captain America’s assassination at the end of Civil War was permanent. I’m saying I wish it didn’t happen.

Now, again, I will agree that there are a select few storylines that benefit from a character being resurrected, or a retcon rewriting their death as “being teleported to the Negative Zone,” or “I faked my death to protect you from harm,” or whatever weird explanation they give. Hell, even the Clone Saga brought back Gwen for a second saying that she was actually a clone. But I wish those cases were few and far between.

That’s one of the reasons why I think the Ultimate Universe is under-appreciated. Most everyone’s deaths in the Ultimate Universe were permanent. Death had an impact on the story because it was an *actual* threat. I like that kind of story.

I don’t know, I just felt I had to say that because I’ve been thinking about it for a while.",1,0.6771041889041921,RF

As for Flashpoint, I understand that Doctor Manhattan controlled how New 52 would start, but according to Pandora he also split the earths into the 3 worlds.

Also does Darkseid War contain anything important here?

Other questions:

 - Did the Miracle Machine come back and did it get ""undone"" yet?

I know that obviously Ammit is portrayed as the villain here so it seems to be ""correct"" to agree with Khonsu bu not neccesarily. Thanos is the villian in the infinity saga but there's discussion online about if what he did was the right thing as well, coz after all I've also heard of some fans saying that the best villians are those who actually believe that they are doing the right thing, especially so for Arthur Harrow.  


Khonsu: ""I only punish those who have chosen evil, I am real justice!""  
He waits for a crime to be committed before punishing them.  


But on the other hand if Ammit was allowed to rule, millions wouldn't have suffered from Hitler's war and genocide and like Harrow said, by the time Khonsu delivers their retribution, people have already suffered, but with Ammit there would be no war, no crime, the world would become an ideal world and I think everyone would be kind hearted? so that way it would seem to make Earth a paradise, not a bad option either.

928,"How do the comics square the concept of mutants with the world at large, vis a vis history and population numbers? I will preface this by saying that my knowledge of the finer bits of the X-men continuity is limited to the movies and some highlighted story beats.  The best explanation I currently have is as follows:  mutants have been around since humanity began (Apocalypse and his original 4 horsemen), but populations spiked (coincidentally) around nuclear bomb testing in the 60s (?) post WW2 (Magneto's whole history if it hasn't been changed).  The world saw an increasing population of scary and powerful people as a threat, several extermination plots were prevented as Professor X and his merry band of students and helpers tried to convince the world that mutant-kind was not a threat, while Magneto and his side tried to take things over with mutants as a superior race.  Phoenix force, yada yada, now mutants are immortal living on an isolated mutant-only island with the goal of protecting their own and being left alone (Hellfire gala subtitles seeming to say they are going to take a more active role in the world). Please correct me if I'm wrong.  

My main question is, if a not-insignificant portion of the world was mutant, that would be literally ALL THE WORLD WOULD CARRY ABOUT, so how big is the ""mutant problem"" compared to everything else going on in the Marvel universe? Forget the Avengers and Thor and aliens when your neighbor can teleport through walls and your mailman's son can shoot bone spurs from his elbows.

How large were mutant populations to justify genocide yet not be the sole focus of the universe? Is this just one of those things that gets brushed over as universes began to collide as comic book writers started crossing characters over, or is there a justification as to why Stark wasn't involved in anti-mutant military weapons, or why Captain America wasn't put on an anti-mutant detail one of the many times he was thawed out in the moving timeline?

1994,"My thoughts on what a shared DC Movie Universe could look like While I’ve enjoyed more of DC’s recent movie offerings, as a huge fan of DC, I still wish they could’ve built a more cohesive movie universe similar to the MCU. I just wanted to share my thoughts on how a film universe could’ve been done and wanted to see people’s thoughts on it.

 I’m just going to make a basic outline on a three phase approach, similar to the MCU’s Infinity Saga. Each phase would build to a Justice League movie that closes the phase out and the Justice League would be based off the classic team of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.

 
Phase 1:

This would obviously be the origin stories phase and each JL member would get their own solo movie. Now granted Superman and Batman could possibly be done without a straight-up origin story with as many solo movies as they’ve had and maybe just have quick flashbacks or references to their origins.

My only stipulation for each solo film for Phase 1 is that the heroes do not fight or come in contact with their arch enemies, which would come into play in the next phase. And possibly a couple of heroes could fight villains connected to Apokolips to have the presence of Darkseid ever looming in Phase 1. So maybe Superman could mainly be dealing with Intergang who have connections with Desaad and Kalibak or Wonder Woman could fight with Big Barda and the female furies (which could be a way to lead Big Barda down the superhero path).

The JL movie could be where the JL face off against Darkseid and while not full on defeating him, are at least able to stop him for this movie. I know a lot of people imagined Darkseid as a villain that caps off several phases similar to Thanos. I honestly feel he is a decent starting villain to bring the JL together that can always be brought back later as more powerful, plus the other JL villains I have in mind I feel can make the stakes much more personal as the movies progress.

 
Phase 2:

This is the phase where each hero would begin to be really challenged and face off against their arch enemies. So for instance Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex, Wonder Woman and Cheetah, Flash and Captain Cold, Green Lantern and Sinestro, Aquaman and Black Manta, and Martian Manhunter and Ma’alefa’ak.

Superman’s second movie with Lex could be the start to Phase 2. After Superman stops Lex in his own movie, Lex can come to the realization that stopping these heroes may require his own team. So he pops up at the end of each of the other movies recruiting the arch villains for each JL member.

This could also be a phase where other heroes are introduced to the world via each of the JL member’s solo movies or maybe having one or two new solo superhero movies, similar to Guardians and Ant-Man for the MCU’s phase 2, that way the world continues to expand and add new heroes. Maybe even in the Green Lantern movie you get an introduction to a new human, such as John Stewart, that will eventually become a Green Lantern.

Phase 2 would be capped off with a JL movie where, as already indicated, the JL fights against the Injustice League/Legion of Doom comprised of Lex, Joker, Cheetah, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Ma’alefa’ak. The story would be loosely based off Tower of Babel where the Injustice League learn of Batman’s secret plans he has created to take down each member of the JL in an emergency and they get a hold of them to take out each JL member. Maybe somewhere along the way Coast City gets destroyed which plays a part into Hal Jordan’s journey for phase 3. After the Injustice League is eventually defeated, the movie ends with the team feeling betrayed by Batman and removing him from the team due to his secret plans to take them out.

 
Phase 3:

This phase would focus on a theme of reflections where each JL member fights a villain that is essentially an evil reflection of them. The remaining JL members begin to see Batman’s point of view on plans that can be used to take them out if they went rogue, but at the same time Batman realizes in his own movie how he may have gone too far with his actions in secretly creating his plans.

For the movies, you could have Superman face off against Zod, Wonder Woman against Grail (which would also be a nice way to reference Darkseid again after three phases), Flash against Reverse Flash, Aquaman against Ocean Master, Green Lantern against Parallax, Batman against Prometheus, and Martian Manhunter against White Martian (not sure on this one completely).

In Flash’s movie, this could introduce the multiverse which will come into play in the third and fourth JL movies.

In the Green Lantern movie, Hal’s grief over Coast City’s destruction could lead to him being corrupted by Parallax, which is where John Stewart could step in as a new Green Lantern to help stop the threat and John Stewart gets inducted into the JL at the end after Hal takes a leave of absence once he is free from Parallax (or Hal possibly dies too in order to really raise the stakes in this universe by showing an actual league member dying).

In Batman’s movie, as he fights against Prometheus, he can see a corrupted version of himself in Prometheus and realize his mistakes with being so secretive about his plans. This Batman movie could also be the last one before the JL movie and Superman could possibly come in to help Batman, where they both make amends, and allows for at least one World’s Finest team up movie.

Again there may be other movies where new heroes are introduced in Phase 3 to continue to expand the universe.

Finally to close out Phase 3, there would be a two part JL movie which would focus on Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate. I imagine in the third movie, the JL members are approached by a good version of Lex from Earth 3 who asks for their help in overthrowing the Crime Syndicate. So the 6 JL members (with John Stewart being the new GL) take the fight to Earth 3. The JL would not win the first fight against the Crime Syndicate and the Crime Syndicate takes advantage of the knowledge of the existence of the JL’s Earth and go to conquer it. Of note, Batman may be mostly absent in this third JL movie to really get the feeling of at least one movie where Batman is off the team.

Then finally in the fourth JL movie, Batman finally makes amends with the remaining JL members after they have experienced what corrupted versions of themselves are like with the villains they faced in Phase 3 and after having just fought and lost to the Crime Syndicate. But Batman also admits his mistakes to the team too, possibly having also come across Owlman on his own in this movie too and learn even more what a corrupted version of him is like. The movie could end in an Endgame level fight of the JL vs Crime Syndicate on the JL’s Earth, along with the Crime Syndicate having brought over some evil versions of other heroes introduced in Phase 2 and 3 that could also all be involved in the fight.

This movie could end the three phase saga with the Justice League having finally expanded their membership and possibly a tease of a greater Crisis coming now that the multiverse has been introduced.",0,1.4844148880883055e-123,NB

748,"This is a long shot, but I am looking for a very specific comic panel from a Spider-Man comic. Long story short, when I was a kid in the mid early to mid 2000's there I went to a library and there was a big black and white book of Spider-Man comics. From what I know about comics now this must have been a collection of reprints, given it was in black and white. I assume it has to be from The Amazing Spider-Man, *maybe* Spectacular Spider-Man, but I don't know much about if they made any big reprint books of those, especially in black and white. I assume it can't be Ultimate Spider-Man despite the popularity at the time given how new the series was, I very much doubt they had any black and white reprints of it then, if they even have them now.

So, I have given the backstory I can and my speculation, from my memory, this is what the actual panel was: 

I assume Spider-Man was sneaking around and spying on someone. I just remember he was probably on a wall spying on someone because the specific thing I remember is he said, **""Gloves don't leave finger prints""**. That is the only concrete thing I remember for sure, I think he may have been being accused of something, but that part could be completely wrong. 

This is why I said it is a long shot, I can't remember much other than the time period, **(mid-2000's)** and he said **""Gloves don't leave finger prints.""**

1518,"My redesign of the Star Saphire's Emblem and Emotional Entity So in my previous post, I mentioned how I was trying to redesign the star sapphire's because of how dumb the emotional entity is and also how out of place the symbol is. So eventually I came to the conclusion of making the new version a plant. My reason is, A, it's the only life form not used in the other designs of the emotional entities, and B, still works when implamenting both the caring side and parasitic side of love. So anyway below is the redesign of the symbol, it represents the emotional entity of The Caretaker, a large planet-spanning plant being. Just like the original Star Sapphires (btw there just called the violet lanterns now for obvious reasons) it recruits members with a great deal of love and makes them become obsessive with that love and imprison that thing to maintain it. However there are a few key differences, first, they imprison the things they love in sap not crystals, second, it's no longer just romantic love it can be any love as long as it can be sealed (like it can't be love for violence unless I can work that in somehow) even entire nations! Because of the third reason, once the item or person is sealed in the sap it's taken back to the homeworld where the Caretaker resides and placed in its forest to be kept intact as long as the lantern helps in also maintaining the Caretaker's forest. Also, no more men aren't included in the corps bs, men aren't exclusive to rage and violence and women aren't exclusive to love. Anyway, that's my redesign of the Violet Lantern corps please let me know what you think and if I should change anything. P.s. if you say to change the color, I will inform you it is violet according to the colors on the program I made it with.

I am trying to find the name and comic book issue of a Batman story.

It is a one-off issue collected in a graphic novel from Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo, I believe.

The story involved Bruce Wayne training (with the League of Assassins?) in which he refused to kill any of the men he was fighting. He fought until the men decided to stop fighting him, due to his indominable spirit.

If you could help identify this comic or point in the direction of someone or another subreddit that could help me, I would appreciate it.

first we have north mythology

middle eastern main actor middle eastern voice actor

if marvel did the same to thor or tor as we call him in sweden we'd have more mystery and a nordic main actor and nordic music, i feel they stayed a lot more faithful to egyptian mythology than they ever did to nordic, if they did the same to egyptian wouldn't it be called cultural appropriation?

I pick up the comics of the characters that interest me and usually before an MCU debut of a character I didn’t know much about I read the essentials. I love 616 but I’ve never read Secret Wars 2015, I don’t know why but well, now I want to and I know it’s a big story so I’m gonna read some stuff before. I haven’t read absolutely every issue since the 60’s but pretty much there with Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Daredevil, X-Men, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Thor, Kamala Khan a lot of Avengers and West Coast, New Avengers etc. And many others I’m really familiar with. I’ve read a lot of 616 post Secret Wars with events and characters I love so I’m catch up I know about the world ending and rebooting but now I want to go back and read Secret Wars this cause as I said I don’t know why I haven’t done it yet and I want to experience the whole thing. Also read some of the preludes like in Ms Marvel last days. This is a list of events and issues that what I’ve come up with looking in the internet with different reading orders to catch up pre Secret Wars. Some of those I’ve already read but I want to have them fresh in my memory. I also plan on reading the Ultimate Universe before.

Basically I would really appreciate all your expertise Marvel fans of this sub to tell me if there are some more issues and events that I’ve missed that would improve my experience reading Secret Wars. It’s gonna be long but I hope it’s worth it. I would also appreciate if you told me which Secret Wars tie ins and BattleWorld issues are the best for you, when I read an event I usually only read the tie ins for the series I’m following, I’ve read everything for Civil War for example and it was too much. I’ve read the Thors one when I read Aaron’s Thor and liked it so if you guys tell me the best tie ins I’ll listen. Thank you! Have a good day if you don’t have suggestions. 


What I plan on reading is:

- Ultimate Universe
- Maybe reread 1602 if I have time 


-Earth 616:

-60’s Fantastic Four (essential issues ig)
-Secret Wars 1 (reread)
-Secret Wars 2
-Infinity Gauntlet/War/Crusade (reread)

-Invincible Iron Man (2006)
-Captain America (Brubaker)
-Secret War
-Civil War (reread)
-One More Day (reread)
-World War Hulk
-Secret Invasion 
-Dark Reign
-Siege (reread)
-Infinity (reread)
-Superior Iron Man 
-FF / Fantastic 4 (Hickman)
-Amazing Spider-Man 2014-2015
-The Incursions (avengers - new avengers)
-Time Runs Out

-Secret Wars 2015

- Tie Ins I’m gonna read (editing the post with your suggestions) : Spider-Man Renew your Vows, Thors (reread).

Like are there housing and apartments? Is there a civilization, tows, city, country sides? Like wtf even goes down on Apokolips?? 

If Darkseid has all these slaves in his control, wtf do they even do if they're is nothing going on?? Like are they mining mineral's? Are they his house cleaners or are they building stuff?? But from what I see they're are no buildings!!! 

It's confusing because Darkseid makes himself out to be this super powerful guy who should be feared but it looks like his planet hasn't evolved past the stone age. It's so plain, so bare bones!!! At least New Genesis is thriving. They evolved so well!! They got beautiful cloud city's and a safe civilization for all, they are thousands of years ahead in technology and clearly give a shit about keeping there planet in good condition. New Genesis actually gives a shit!!

It seems to me like Darkseid is just a lazy, unmotivated, jealous fedora tippin' man who's having a rage fit all the time. I mean no wonder he's always at war with New Genesis or Earth, he's probably jealous af!! These planets have achieved what Darkseid could never as a ruler. 

I mean please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, I'd love to know if Apokolips is actually a thriving planet growing and evolving, I'd love to hear some Apokolips history and lore. To me it just seems like a bunch of nothingness, so maybe they just never show it??

The Scarlet Witch, while tearing through the Illuminati in a magic-child-induced rage, engaged in conversation with Mr. Fantastic (which shouldn'tve happened, and seemed out of character for her since she was already in that deep), who explained that black bolt could easily destroy her with a single word, which is completely true.

He, for some reason, flexes and smiles. LITERALLY WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?? That is so out of character for him! He literally never acts cocky any other time, even apologizing while killing alternate Dr. Strange!

Wanda asks, ""what mouth?"", revealing that she has removed his mouth from existence, which first of all was shocking and interesting, but then HE SCREAMS. This is what gets me. He understands the power of his ability, and never speaks any other time, even at emotional provocation, but just yells 'cause why not.

1784,"DC Infinite App (iOS) - Can someone help, or am I just being really stupid? Hi folks

Sorry to ask this, at the risk of seeming dumb, but the app feels really unintuitive to use in certain ways and so I was hoping someone could help.

I'm trying to read collected storylines from their own suggested storylines, but I'm having a problem with getting the comics to keep loading in reading order.

For instance, if there's a storyline which spans over multiple series, let's say for simplicity the story order is;

Batman 1, Batman 2, JLA 1, Batman 3, JLA 2, Robin 1, Batman 4

when I select the storyline in question, it shows all the various books initially, but when I start to read, I'll get through Batman 1 and 2 ok, but when I hit ""read next"" from Batman 2, it jumps right to Batman 3, rather than JLA 1, if that makes sense?

Is there a way to do this that actually follows the reading order when hitting ""read next"" rather than the issue order of the current series?

Apologies again if I'm just being really stupid here.",0,3.3504311807796365e-19,NB

77,"My Problem With Everyone Making Fun of Mr. Fantastic Now as we all know the movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness recently came out and if you don't know that, have you been living under a rock and I'm being serious with that question?

Anyway I digress, in the movie Mr. Fantastic tells Wanda, Black Bolt's only power that being his voice in which Wanda simply removes the hole in Black Bolt's face containing his mouth. Black Bolt freaks out and blows his own brains out but with a sound instead of a gun, Mr. Fantastic horrified by what Wanda did freaks out and tries to grab Wanda but she simply shreds him and turns him into cottage cheese.

Now as most people know Mr. Fantastic has been getting ""memeed on"" so to speak with there being memes calling him the dumbest man in the world or saying that he forgot that he is the smartest man alive. At first I didn't mind these memes as I thought that everyone was right and Mr. Fantastic made a dumb decision, which I'm not saying didn't make ***A*** dumb decision meaning one but I'm saying that the decision to tell Wanda about Black Bolt was only semi-dumb. You see for those of you who weren't really paying attention to the situation and just wanted a fight, Mr. Fantastic thought he could simply intimidate Wanda into surrendering. Being that he found Strange to be more dangerous than Wanda he though Wanda would be a walk in the park compared to Strange. So as an intimidation attempt he told Wanda what Black Bolt could do to Wanda, as we all know Wanda was not at all intimidated and took away Black Bolt's face hole making him blow up from the inside out.

Now where Mr. Fantastic makes the dumb decision is in what he does next, instead of being calm about the situation he freaks out and you can see it in his face as soon as Black Bolt dies. Reed looks like he just lost not only his best friend (which he did), but his most powerful ally (which he kind of did I mean Captain Marvel wasn't much help) and so decides he can maybe restrain Wanda but she sees it coming and kills him. Also I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared or sad when your friend is brutally murdered in front of you but I'm saying if you have bigger fish to fry (metaphorically speaking) then you should fry the fish then mourn. Also just because your the smartest man alive doesn't mean you don't sometimes make dumb decisions or just not have feelings, and remember feelings make us all act dumb sometimes.

Anyway I'm glad I got that out of the way.",1,1.0,NB

She also cheated on him with freakin Bruce and got mad at him for being non consensually kissed by Tarantula and broke up with him for it.

Now onto him, they are willing to destroy essential parts of him just to have him with her, having him cheat on Kory before their wedding (even though I’m like 90% sure he was still under brother Bloods control) they also have a habit of making his skills less to make her look good.

Don’t get me started on how she handled the whole Ric Grayson arc it’s no wonder he didn’t want anything to do with her or the other Batfam with how she treated him when he didn’t remember her.

Yeah, the second half of this movie was totally Sam Raimi and it was dope af. Liz Olsen nearly steals the show, she was absolutely fucking good af and is easily the best she was in the whole MCU. Strange, he was..I'd say as good as he always has been. Liz actually did surpass him, but that's not a knock on Benedict by any means, he was the second best as far as leads go.

I feel like this movie could have been a little bit better, like if the first half was just as good as the second half as far as the tone goes, but it was still pretty damn solid overall

I also found it pretty cool to see Stewart as Charles and John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic! Now I do not know if Charles will return in the future, given Wanda broke his neck and a small guess is that was just a throwaway fan service moment, but Krasinski for sure will reprise Mr. Fantastic, given a F4 reboot is on the way. He was pretty cool for the little bit of time he had in this movie and was so Stewart.

1028,"What is your favorite and least favorite adaptational origin change? Every superhero adaptation takes liberties, and origins are a common thing to change for better or worse. On this thread, list what adaptational origin you liked best, and which one you hated most of all. And why one worked and why the other did not.

Both of mine involved then hero's parent not being whom they thought they were. 

Best: Batman the Telltale Game. In this episodic game retelling of  Batman's early career, Bruce Wayne learns a horrifying secret about his family. Thomas and Martha Wayne, had ties to the mob and worked with Carmine Falcone and Hamilton Hill. Wayne Enterprises was also a greedy  and amoral corporation that did all the terrible things that real world  corporations do to people and the planet. One day however, Thomas went too far and Martha(who had at least a little bit more standards)  threatened to leave him and take Bruce with her. Thomas soon began to  start thinking about leaving crime behind. But when Mayor Hill found out  about this, he feared Thomas would become a security risk, and hired a  thug named Joe Chill to murder him.

There are a number of reasons why this works for me. The first is because this change allows Batman to keep going strong in the changing world today, as our views of the rich are not as glamorous as they used to be. This also shows how Bruce was never corrupted by the power and wealth he was born into. This also serves as a catalyst of why he is Batman. Because some of the members of his rogues gallery in this continuity, became villains because of Thomas Wayne. So Bruce sees being Batman as correcting his fathers crimes. And finally, this solves a minor issue I have with Batman's origin. Thomas and Martha Wayne were two of the most respected and loved citizens of Gotham. If they were killed in a mugging, it would be all over the news and the murderer would have nowhere to run. But if Chill was a paid hitman who had friends in the Mob, they could protect him when the cops would come looking for him. And it shows gamers and audiences what kind of corruption plagues the world of the elite.

Now for my most hated origin change. Shazam 2019. I once never thought one slip-up could ruin a whole movie. This movie proved me wrong. When Billy Batson finally meets his biological mother, he finds out that she abandoned him due to being unwilling to care for him, and as punishment, she now lives in a poor apartment, with a minimum wage job, and abusive boyfriend. She also reveals that she was kicked out of home due to a teen pregnancy and her boyfriend was incarcerated. She also shows no love for the boy. The whole reason this scene exists, is so that Billy will accept his adoptive family as his real one. And they did a terrible job of doing it.

Why this does not work? Where to begin? I know what she did was wrong, but what Billy doesn't get, and what the movie does not show, was that both he and his mother were screwed over by the system that the Telltale Thomas Wayne ran. Homelessness is caused by things like poverty, long term unemployment, desperation, bias against the homeless, and even disasters, all of which are caused by capitalism. I don't think she would have abandoned him had she not been screwed over. There's a much greater evil at work in that scene, but the movie and Billy refused to show or see it, and the narrative does something that capitalism does, blame poverty, hardship, and misery on the poor and downtrodden. I would have expected a poor orphan like Billy Batson to know what it's like to live under an unfair system that can make people desperate enough to do terrible things, given that he's supposed to be even kinder then Superman. While I initially applauded the movie for it's themes of there is no such thing as pure of heart, maybe it needed Billy to be pure of heart. And it served no purpose apart from appreciating his adopted family. There are much better ways to show it, but that's all it does. It doesn't serve as a catalyst him to be a better hero, and it shifts the blame from a fixed system to a victim of it. And by doing that, it does the audience no favors. Not to mention that with Roe V Wade overturned, this hurts a lot more.

Older Iconic marvel hero’s have a dramatic edge that she lacks.

512,"My Pitch For An Avengers Game No ideas for a story or campaign, mainly just how it would work and stuff.

It would be an open-world game where you can explore New York. The game would feature Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor as the main/starter characters. Eventually, more people such as Black Panther and Ant-Man would be added. You'd be able to switch between all 6 members at any time and the ones not used will occasionally attack an enemy.  Like Insomniac's Spider-Man, there would be the missions tab on the menu which would be used to play missions to play out the hero's origins. There would be an equipment system in the game and it would change the appearance. However, you'd be able to switch to a cosmetics tab that would let you choose armors you have to apply for the look only and change the color schemes of each item or the entire armor, like in Destiny 2.  Iron Man would work differently than this, where he would have the equipment system still, but his would not only buff it but they would be parts of different armors and marks that would be weaker if it's not in the full set. You'd be able to switch into different avengers by using a system like Insomniac's Spider-Man where you hold a button, time slows, and you can choose a character through a menu. It'd also feature an event system, where after the campaign, there would be events where there would be boss battles or big fights, such as a Chitauri invasion or a Black Order battle.",1,1.0,NB

Im just tired of Peter being broke and life just sucks all around for him. I think it’s boring that his character never seems to get anywhere.

In case you didn’t realise, the Marvel Comics multiverse is the 7th generation (now 8th), and it is embodied by two figures: Eternity (the embodiment of Time) and Infinity (the embodiment of Space).

Each universe has a smaller version of these beings, and this is what we see in Thor L&amp;T.

But where is Infinity? She’s meant to be alongside Eternity, but at the centre of the universe (in the hall and on Eternity’s spiritual plane) she’s nowhere to be found.

Love is a new character (she isn’t in the comics) so Taika must be doing something new.

She is born from Eternity (and seems to possess his powers. Not to mention she‘s a girl (just like Infinity is depicted).

But here’s the clincher: When Love is revived by Eternity we see her reflection in the water. A female version of Eternity; Infinity.

The dialogue was horrible, the acting was terrible (Even Christian Bale had some really bad moments, though Gor was a pretty good villain). The writing was the worst. It tried to crank the silly factor of Ragnarok up tenfold and just succeeded in pure absurdity.

    Q1: will we see the Penguin on Young Justice? I’m a huge fan of the character and would love to see him on the show.:smiley:

GW: I’m afraid my answer to this - as to most of these kinds of questions - is NO SPOILERS. But we did MENTION Penguin in Phantoms. So at least you know an Earth-16 version of ol’ Oswald exists. 

    Q2: Who will be in the team? Will Greta Hayes be in it — asking for a friend :eyes:

GW: Targets takes place only a month after Phantoms! The roster of the Team will not have changed. 

    Q3: I was curious if this was an idea that got left out of the current season or a new idea that came about after the season was written. I love this show and hope for another season or at least more comic series.

GW: These are ideas which Brandon Vietti and I have had for some time…We’re finally getting around to “portraying” them in Targets. 

    Q4: I love that characters that first appeared in the original YJ tie-in comic series a decade ago like Wyynde, King Sha’ark, Blubber got to eventually show up in animation in YJ Seasons 3 and 4.
    
    Is YJ: Targets introducing any new characters that Chris got to design/draw that we may see again down the line in the animated series?

GW: YES!

CJ: Obviously that would be dependent on their being future seasons to appear in (#SaveEarth16), but we’ve already had characters from the previous tie-in comics make their way into the TV show, so it could certainly happen again! 

    Q5: Hey Greg and Chris, thanks for coming back! That was a really phenomenal season finale we just watched. I’ve got one question though – how were Zod and the other Phantom Zoners instantly able to address Metropolis in English when they emerged from the Boom Tube? Thanks!

GW: Ma’alefa’ak downloaded English to their minds!

    Q6: From what I’ve read online, it appears that each story will have a back up story as well. Will the backup be solo adventures of our heroes or villains from the past or team adventures filling in some gaps from the TV show, and was their a Young Justice character, you wanted to include more of but just didn’t have the space to do so.

GW: There are always characters that we want to devote more screen or page time to. Always. As for the back-ups, the first one focuses on Red Arrow. As for the other five… wait and see! 

    Q7: I don’t see the point in putting a question when mine never get asked but whatever. In hopefully future seasons, will you be continuing to focus on the OG Team?

GW: If you don’t ask, you can’t get an answer! :wink: We’ll always pay attention to the so-called OGs. But each season is intentionally different from past seasons. But the best way to show growth in the characters is to have earlier seasons’ versions of those characters to compare them to. 

    Q8: My question is I’m curious to why Vandal Savage was chosen as the big bad or an important one at least and will his plan continues to grow in these comics?

GW: Vandal’s historic history, going back 50K years made the idea of putting him up against young heroes extremely appealing to Brandon Vietti and myself. But that doesn’t guarantee that he’s involved with EVERY story. So I’m not going to reveal whether he is or isn’t involved in Targets. No spoilers! 

    Q9: I’m a bit confused on the timeline, which might just be because I’m stupid, but is the child that Ursa is pregnant with in the season finale supposed to be, genetically at least, a version of Lor-Zod? Or did the present day Ursa already give birth to Lor?

GW: The former, if I’m reading your question correctly. 

    Q10: When will you two work on the next Gargoyles?

CJ: Look closely at the pages of the second issue of YJ Targets for the answer to your question…

GW: There’s an Easter egg there just waiting to hatch… 

    Q11: Hi Greg and Chris!! I absolutely loved the finale of S4 and all the episodes and how we got to see the original team again. Will the YJ Targets series introduce any new characters that we have not seen before and will some team members have new outfits and or designs?

CJ: It’s been only a short time since the conclusion of Young Justice Season 4, so the designs and outfits are pretty much unchanged since Phantoms, but you ABSOLUTELY WILL be seeing some new characters in upcoming issues.

    Q12: what made you decide to give Conner only some of his power from the comic in this series.

GW: We wanted to go with 1938 Superman powers. Powers that were simply an extension and expansion of what a human could do. So Infrared vision, as opposed to heat vision. Super-leaping instead of flying, etc.

    Q13: What was it like voicing Lucas Carr and being the one marrying Miss M and SB? After all this time, did you feel something special when you finished recording the dialogue that closed up what was opened back in pretty much episode 2?

GW: It felt like the culmination of a decade’s worth of work, honestly. You can hear Lucas choke up, and truthfully, I choke up every time I watch that wedding, especially the vows. (And, yeah, I know that sounds immodest, since I wrote them, but all credit to Danica and Nolan for voicing them with so much sincere feeling!)

    Q14: I know you said numerous times there will never be a definitive ending to Young Justice, that you only do open-ended closure.
    But i have to know do you have a ending for the Darkseid Saga planned? Because i feel like it’s leading up to be essentially your Infinity Saga.

GW: We have plans for where we’re going for most of our storylines. But Darseid Is… 

    Q15: I absolutely loved the season 4 finale. I have a nitpick-y question regarding the wedding scene. Conner mentioned that everyone there was “in the know,” so I’m curious about how Wendy Harris and Harper &amp; Cullen Row found out (as in, who told them and when)? Thank you so much for your time and another wonderful season! Can’t wait to read Targets!

GW: Harper and Cullen were filled in when they moved in with foster parents Lucas and Bethany. Wendy figured it out. I’m not going to go into any more detail than that, because we might want to SHOW those scenes some day.

    Q16: How does it feel to see some of the characters you designed for the comic tie-in (Sha’lain’a, King Sha’ark, Wyynde, etc.) make the jump to the series in seasons 3 and 4?

CJ: It was amazing getting to see characters we introduced (the YJ versions at least) in the comic make their way into the TV show. With the characters from the Atlantis arc especially, those characters had to be aged up in adapting them for the TV show, and I got to help update the design for Ronal specifically! I’d love to see more “cross-pollination” between the TV show and comic if they both continue!

    Q17: With such a talented voice cast with the likes of Jessie McCartney, Troy Baker, Tara Strong, and more on the show, have you guys ever considered doing a musical episode for YJ, and do you think it is still in the cards for the future?

GW: We always include at least one song per season. And Chris and Kristopher Carter and I produced a YJ RadioPlay at CONvergence convention one year that was a full-on musical. ([You can find it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ9Q4LJ3Lbk)) As for doing an actual musical episode of the show, I’d be game, but Brandon Vietti and I would have to find a valid reason - beyond just “Hey, wouldn’t this be fun (though a pain) to produce!” to make it actually fit into our fairly realistic Earth-16. 

    Q18: How much of the original 5-season plan is still intact?

GW: All of it, really. Keep in mind that plan was broad strokes. It wasn’t about little details. So we didn’t tweak anything on that broad strokes level based on the long hiatus.

    Q19: Will you guys be appearing in Comic Conventions in the East Coast this year?
    
    …and if you were given green light to do as you please within DC comics, how many more comics would you two put out right after Targets? How many more story arcs you already have in mind with these amazing characters in this amazing Earth 16?

GW: Personally, I haven’t been invited to any upcoming conventions anywhere, so… nope, I won’t be appearing. And I’d be willing to do as many comics as DC’ll let us do. REALLY, TRULY not worried about running out of stories.

CJ: I’m hoping to get to New York Comic Con this year. Between the pandemic and my schedule since moving to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers Animation I haven’t been able to get to a convention in a couple of years and I really miss getting to see fans!

And I’d always be down for more Young Justice comics if I could fit them into my schedule. I love these characters and never tire of helping tell their stories.

    Q20: Why did you make Hal suddenly look solder than his peers in YJ? He is actually younger than Bruce or Clark in comics.

GW: On Earth-16, Hal is actually a tad older than Clark and Bruce. But, really, the decision to have him be a bit gray at the temples was the choice of our original lead character designer and 3rd Season Art Director, Phil Bourassa. He suggested it, and Brandon Vietti and I said, sure.

    Q21: How long do you intend to keep teasing the return of Jason Todd?

GW: Who says he’s returning? :wink:

    Q22: Will we get to see more of wonder girl as she the leader of the outsiders ?!

GW: Yes. In Young Justice: Targets! Keep reading!

    Q23: Greg Weisman, will there be a sequel to Catwoman: Hunted?

GW: I have no idea, but I hope so. It was designed to be the first story in a trilogy of tales. We’ll just have to wait and see…

    Q24: Also, just wanna thank you for the representation of people with autism. I have it myself and I appreciate the whole arc about Rocket coming to understand her son through seeing Orion and how you acknowledge both the experiences of the autistic person himself and those of loved ones like parents. Man, I could go on and on and on about it lmao. Also just love all the representation in general. :00_dc_pride: :00_dc_pride_ps: :heart:

GW: Thanks. We’re always trying to increase the show’s representation on multiple fronts. We know how important it is to our fans. It’s important to us, as well.

    Q25: How is the process different when writing/drawing for the comics versus working on the show?

CJ: There’s a lot of overlap - it’s still drawing superheroes and visual storytelling. But instead of planning for movement in a static frame, you’re creating sequential art and having to figure out how to fit everything onto a page and allow room for dialog and make sure that the composition leads the eye across all the elements of the page in the correct order…there are a lot of differences!

GW: It’s not really all that different for me. It’s just about striving to tell stories in shorter chunks. A standard-length comic book issue is about the equivalent of 1/3 of an animated episode. And each page of a comic book needs to tell a mini-story of it’s own. Beyond that, I also need to keep in mind that I won’t have my voice cast to fall back upon, etc. And no ACTUAL movement, just the implication of movement. So I just have to remind myself to cover my bases differently.

    Q26: any new characters from this season going to be regulars in the next season? i liked megans family. they were fun to watch. hopefully more martians in season 5.

GW: No spoilers. (Assuming we get a next season.)

    Q27: will we see redhood in the series as we knew he died around season 2 it would be nice to see him.

GW: Who says you haven’t seen him? :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

CJ: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for supporting the show and the comic. We’d very much love to do more if there’s enough support for it!

GW: Out of time. But thanks for asking your questions. Hope you enjoyed the answers. Meanwhile, #KeepBingingYJ and READ #YoungJusticeTargets to help us #SaveEarth16!",0,4.116670032353207e-14,NB

They make it a point to pronounce all the other brown names/words without the English accent.

Also I'm using Kingo in the Eternals because he's the one with the clearest socio-economic status.

**Richer than some countries**

Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther

**Multiple mansions or other tremendously valuable things**

Kingo, Ms. Marvel

**Vaguely upper class**

**Homeless, but they know people**

Hulk, Captain America, Loki, Black Widow, Captain Marvel,  

**Homeless and crap connections**

Guardians of the Galaxy 

&amp;#x200B;

**My take on the most impractical**

**Captain America**

Many members of the US military wind up underpaid on the street. Captain America happens to be a celebrity from a bygone era who came back to save the world more than once. He's a rare case where he's actually a veteran of more than 4 wars, so the dude definitely deserves some government subsidies.

**Ms Marvel**

Her grandmother, a single woman, became a refugee in Pakistan, where she was able to work her way up in society to the highest levels and afford a massive mansion. Then her daughter, an immigrant, came to America and managed to get a swanky, rather large two floor house in the Jersey City suburbs back in like the 1980's.

**Tony Stark**

He was a public figure war profiteer who went on to bash his entire industry, and spend his fortune on himself, buying fancy houses and making high tech suits of armor. The last time he actually sells something is in Iron Man 1, at the very beginning of the film, and somehow over the course of the movies, he keeps getting richer.",1,1.0,NB

The reason why Mjöllnir choose Jane as the new Thor in the comics , is that Thor became unworthy, but in the MCU Thor is still worthy and I doubt that the comics unworthy Thor storyline is going to happen in LOVE and Thunder.

After failing in Infinity War , Thor felt unworthy , let himself go, and became a little weird , And he gone on a crazy adventure to find peace.

During the time high Thor got a pep talk from his mom, allowing him to achieve his redemption arc, and him being able to summon Mjöllnir made him feel worthy again.

Which was a type of validation. It was a sign of his failures are forgiven and now he can forge a new path for himself and remember that Ragnarok was about the understanding that he's not defined by his hammer .

**But Who's Jane From Thor Love And Thunder ?**

Remember , Jane is a very smart woman. She's a leading astrophysicist and astronomer, and she's an expert on all things related to Asgard.

She is the first human mortal who probably ever set foot on the ground of Asgard. All of those things are the reason why [she received a Nobel Prize](https://www.hotseatmag.com/article/how-jane-fixes-the-hammer-and-becomes-worthy-in-thor-love-and-thunder).

\- In the earliest issues of Superboy that I have (early 1950s) he attends Smallville High School, goes on dates, etc.

\- In The New Adventures of Superboy #1 (1980) it is his 16th birthday. Right before that, in Superboy/Legion #258-259, he leaves the Legion in order to not learn too much about his own future. 

\- In Superman: The Secret Years (1985) he transitions from Superboy to Superman, during college.  


So my question is, do all of the Legion adventures happen before his 16th birthday, or is the New Adventures of Superboy (I haven't read it yet) modern retellings of stuff from Volume 1? Has anyone put together a Superboy chronology that might include Adventure Comics?

612,"Marvel multiverse concept gives off the same energy as disney live action remakes I haven't watched MUM yet but the entire idea seems like a lazy concept.

Again, I haven't watched dr. strange yet so maybe it's actually good and I'm being cynical but if they do another multiverse movie then it's just giving Disney live-action remakes. 

Also, I feel like they put in so much effort trying to make endgame an epic last hurrah by going all out and killing a bunch of avengers but after throwing away 110% of their material they don't know what to do now hence the (IMO) lazy ideas for new movies. I mean how convenient is it for them to get rid of a bunch of characters and put their stories to rest but now they have this whole new universe where none of that actually happened so they could do it all over again. 

Also, this was written at 3 am after i heard smth of Hugh Jackman coming back as logan in the multiverse and chris evans coming back as human torch and the new young avengers era so if this makes no sense and the English is shitty blame it on sleep deprivation (I'll be taking no accountability but also if u wanna have aggressive discussions in the comments I support that too).",1,1.0,NB

967,"Question about Immortal X-Men #1 So just finished, and I thiiiink I get the twist with Moira at the end generally, but wanted to address some lingering questions.

So, the process goes like this:

Future Sinister learns something past Sinister needs to know. He uploads the info to a Moira clone, kills a Moira clone, and then Sinister activates the X-gene from a baby Moira (or several?) to get the info, Sinister downloads it, and he knows what happens in the future. 

So, my questions are as follows:

1) Are these future Sinisters done when the Moira clone dies? Does the timeline essentially collapse and end with her death, or it is essentially like Sinister claps his hands and says ""I know that'll come in handy for past me!"" and keep going?

2) If he is getting information from future timelines that end once Moira dies, wouldn't he receive all the information immediately once he first set up this game of Moira Telephone? A post I read indicated that would likely be the case due to time travel, but it does not seem to be. If so, how is he getting the information incrementally??",1,0.999995678666338,NB
345,"Is Black Panther inseparable from his race? Hi, I've been reading comments on forums about race swapping and it got me thinking about BP. it seems that his race is  inseparable from his character to the point that's solely the only thing thats interesting about him. People say that you can't change his race because that would undermine his character; that you have to have black skin to be black panther, which seems kind of weird. Its like fans are saying a white person raised in born and raised in African or wakanda his entire life can't become black panther solely because his skin isn't black, that seems to run counter to the message that skin color shouldn't matter in being a hero. It also seems no one mentions the fact that white people live in African too so their could be a basis for a white black panther.

447,"Bully Maguire is a character in my Marvel headcanon. Among the headcanons I'm writing I thought of the crazy idea of turning a meme like Bully Maguire into a character, someone with an actual role. At this point I don't know how big his involvement will be but the premise I came up with for him involves him being a villain in a multiverse crossover I'm planning. Since the stories are in development they're not meant to be elaborate yet. Basically the meme known as Bully Maguire in this is just an alternate version of the 2002 Sony universe Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) whom in this alternate universe, during the third movie's events chose to embrace the violent and aggressive nature given to him by Venom and in the future uses his genius to become a successful industrialist, but over the course of several years he finds a planet where symbiotes live peacefully but uses the tech he develops to control them with a hive mind (kind of like Tony Stark but with aliens instead of armors), and somehow in a strange twist of events he becomes an evil warlord who kills any superhero in his universe and tries to use his hive controlled symbiotes to rule the world, typical villain goals. But instead of having a cause he just does it cause he can, like the personality we saw in the meme he acts humorous, has a big ego, banters and taunts his enemies, and a characteristic is that he never masks cause his face symbolizes fear to his enemies (or something like that, Bully Maguire never masks). This is just a premise basically, his involvement in my story isn't that deep outside of one confrontation with the main characters but I actually want him to have a fight with Scarlet Witch at some point. I'd like to know what you think about this. I still think it's a ridiculous idea but in my head I think it could work with a good hand.",1,1.0,NB

1779,"Would it make sense to say that Superman has been reduced to a simple hero with godly abilities and not focused on the ideals that he represents, while Batman is continuously glorified as a perfect being in every way without focusing on his flawed humanity? The DC heroes are most well-known for their iconography and what they are meant to represent.

The Superman icon, the original hero, is a representation of a person who has so many abilities, almost like that of a god (sometimes when more powerful than what he usually is in the main DC storyline like Superman Prime) but chose to reduce himself to our level, we humans, because he believes that he does is the right thing.

There are obvious similarities here with Christianity and American idealism.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end, the iconography of Superman is the representation of genuine and just protection from any harm. In short, he is truly meant to be an icon of hope, justice and the American way even if he is a classic hero.

However, I feel that the iconography of Superman has been changed into just simply portraying him as perfect but he is never focused on what he represents even if he is considered as boring because in the end, he is meant to give a feeling of hope that everyone he encounters, no matter how hard their day was or what the person was going through.

We tend to see Superman being portrayed in a manner where we are provoked to question his principles and actions as someone with all that power, a God amongst us humans, may be provoked to think otherwise that he would deem as just - such as in The Dark Knight Returns storyline, in the Red Sun comic and in the Injustice arc.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, Batman is almost an anti-hero version of Superman where his idea of justice is more blurry as he can sometimes jump between vengeance and justice, or between going by the book or vigilantism or a necessary evil.

However, it seems that Batman, being the most popular superhero, is implemented in almost every storyline possible, even in stories where he is out of place such as in the Justice League Dark film, and where he is portrayed as a person who is almost perfect and just in every way, almost like a super-righteous knight.

The most common example that comes to mind is how Batman seems to have been ""fanboy""-ied into being the kind of hero that can anyone with preparation and resources, no matter how powerful or smart or numerous his opponents are.

Or that no matter what Batman thinks or does, no matter how dark his thoughts may be or how brutal or shocking his methods are, he is considered as always the right and the hero of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

However, being that Batman is meant to be a human being who has limits in terms of power when compared to meta beings, he is meant to represent to flaw nature of humanity - our way of thinking, and our way of life, as Batman was raised in human culture and is most familiar with the shockingly brutal reality of Gotham and Arkham.

But even though Batman is meant to be a human being and even if he is identified as a genius and implements logic in his methods and principles such as in his ""no-killing"" rule and is very aware of himself, I do not think that we often see Batman being placed in positions where he is provoked to question my morals, principles or even his sanity considering how blurry and conveniently human they are (at least, not in mainstream media).

We managed to have storylines where Batman was provoked to be in this position a couple of times such as in the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, in the Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth story, in the Long Halloween storyline, or in The Joker: Devil's Advocate story, or one instance in the Killing Joke, 

But it seems that every time the Dark Knight is portrayed, at least in most mainstream media, Batman is worshipped in almost every way and that no matter what his actions and ideas are, he is always the hero - in the Lego Batman film is where we find this most prominently where his hero worship was used as the main driving humour of the story.

It is as though Batman is impervious to criticism and he is always the hero in the end - no matter if he was the extreme rebel in the Red Son story, or the brutal and narcissistic person in the All-Star storyline and in the Dark Knight Returns, or how thorough and defensive he was in the Tower of Babel story where he made contingency plans for every Justice League member without their knowledge, or no matter what parenting style he uses to the Robin family (usually done in a very disciplinary manner which the Red Hood sometimes uses as an excuse for his anger towards Batman)

&amp;#x200B;

It feels ironic that these beings are portrayed in almost opposite ways than what they are meant to be where Batman is meant human at his core and being human means being flawed, while Superman is meant to be perfect but meant to be a representation of an ideal despite his almost omnipotent existence",0,2.514141871955815e-75,NB

993,"Unpopular opinion: I wish Marvel deaths were permanent Well, okay, let me elaborate: I wish character deaths in Marvel Comics were permanent *for the most part.* I mean, yeah, in a few cases it makes sense for the character to come back, I get it. But a lot of the best storylines involve a main character dying — Death of Spider-Man, Dark Phoenix Saga, Death of Captain Marvel, The Night Gwen Stacy Died, and many others included. All of those stories I listed involve someone (Ultimate Spider-Man, Jean Grey, Mar-Vell the original Captain Marvel, Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn) being killed for real. The only characters that came back were Jean and Norman, and they came back after *at least* a couple decades.

No, this is not me saying that I wish Captain America’s assassination at the end of Civil War was permanent. I’m saying I wish it didn’t happen.

Now, again, I will agree that there are a select few storylines that benefit from a character being resurrected, or a retcon rewriting their death as “being teleported to the Negative Zone,” or “I faked my death to protect you from harm,” or whatever weird explanation they give. Hell, even the Clone Saga brought back Gwen for a second saying that she was actually a clone. But I wish those cases were few and far between.

That’s one of the reasons why I think the Ultimate Universe is under-appreciated. Most everyone’s deaths in the Ultimate Universe were permanent. Death had an impact on the story because it was an *actual* threat. I like that kind of story.

And OH MY GOD !? 

I've read about 20 chapters till now (started last night lol) and I love it to bits. It's SO CUTE and it's all the content I've wanted from the batfam. The characters are actually pretty well and coherently written and treated with respect. The writers definitely did their research so it doesn't feel out of touch with the canon. There's growth and character development which is so refreshing to see. 

I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea and I respect that; personally I love that they're showing the family as flawed humans who are trying to be better and for me that's what good characters have always been about. (Instead of being rebooted to the same arc over and over again because edge lords on the internet think heroes should also be sad and brooding fighting machines)

I don't even care if it's just fanfiction this is MY canon. I love it SO SO MUCH AHHH I actually tear up when I read it because well ITS REALLY CUTE

By the way, did Tobey Spider-Man have anything to say about how the MMU Jameson looks almost exactly like his Jameson, just with less hair? (MCU is Marvel Comics Universe; why are we using it for Cinematic? I'm invoking Marvel Movie Universe.)

And when did Peter turn 18? Or is the age of adulthood in New York younger than 18. Because Pete could sue Jameson into oblivion if he was still a minor.

So did Strange's spell wipe all the electronic devices of any image or video of Peter? Maybe he said, and I wasn't paying that close attention. Because I imagine Ned and MJ looking through their phones, and finding pictures of this guy they have no memory of.

And then Peter walks into her place of work, and they're not ""Who are you? Why do I have hundreds of pictures of you?""

I know after Crisis it left behind one earth, and what happened after Infinite Crisis? It seems some got merged. Did anything big happen to it after Final Crisis? Which earth became ""New Earth""?

As for Flashpoint, I understand that Doctor Manhattan controlled how New 52 would start, but according to Pandora he also split the earths into the 3 worlds. Why did he do that and how does Pandora know about Manhattan? What is the effect on the multiverse after Doomsday Clock, was there any? Though it seems Doomsday Clock is in an entirely different continuity

As for Dark Nights I think I understand most of it that every universe became validated, and it seems to connect with the 3 Crisis stories. Does it have any connection to Doomsday Clock or is it pretty unrelated? Does it connect to Flashpoint?

Also does Darkseid War contain anything important here?

Other questions:

 - Did the Miracle Machine come back and did it get ""undone"" yet?

- Who is above The Hands?

- How long has Geoff Johns been planning Doomsday Clock? According to wiki, Pandora mentions Manhattan during Flashpoint in 2011 but I’m not sure about that",0,1.5610178468362806e-20,NB
