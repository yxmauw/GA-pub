1657974418,CEO_of_Redd1t,Explaining why the MCU is Earth-616 now in the best way I can...,"So there's been a lot of discussion lately about the MCU's designation as Earth-616. Some people have called it a mistake, others have tried to explain it with in-universe lore and others have accepted it as 616.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here today to try and do my best at explaining why the MCU is being called 616 now, and why it actually makes (some) sense. So without further ado let's begin!

&amp;#x200B;

First: The TVA and Earth 838

[The TVA's Tape](https://preview.redd.it/aemvzgzw4xb91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd6f8daaaeaf659060c8ded0bc8cb0a09cb20b00)

So as you may know, the TVA and Baxter Foundation (from Earth 838) have both independently designated the main MCU timeline as 616. This has been the deal breaker for many theories that claim that Earth 838 was making their own unique designations, as that is clearly not the case.

My theory is this: The Baxter Foundation of 838 (with its knowledge of other universes and Incursions) is aware of the multiversal calamity and the multiversal power -The TVA- trying to fix it.

My prediction for Loki S2 is that we will see 838 (and various other universes) be involved the multiversal shenanigans, possibly merging the Baxter Foundation and a version of the TVA (since as we are led to believe at the end of Loki S1, the TVA appears to have branched) which gives them the info and data surrounding other universes that we then see in Dr Strange MOM.

&amp;#x200B;

Second: Nate Moore's Statement and Kevin Feige

[Kevin Feige](https://preview.redd.it/lnjoqo7h6xb91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8b2798d2f0161d0a3aaadfeefcea40a9164f7a)

Nate Moore (A producer at Marvel Studios) has gone on record to say that the MCU is in Earth-616.

Kevin Feige (The President of Marvel Studios) seems to agree with this, as Iman Vellani (the actor who portrayed Ms. Marvel) mentioned how Feige made a '616' with his hands towards her during her AMA on r/marvelstudios.

Both men are higher-ups at Marvel, which would suggest that they know what they're talking about. But how can that be? How can those designations from the TVA, Earth-838, Kevin Feige and Nate Moore be true? Well, that leads me to the final part of this post:

&amp;#x200B;

Third: How it works in-universe.

Some of you may be pretty familiar with pop-culture's designs for the 'omniverse' (everything there is, can be, has been and will be) so may know what I'm talking about when I mention the term: 'megaverse'.

The term megaverse is one of the smaller parts of the overall 'archverse' heirachy, essentially being the multiverse of the multiverse. A megaverse contains infinite multiverses, which each contain infinite universes.

We've seen examples of megaverses in Marvel when the Marvel and DC universes met in the 'Amalgam universe' in the comics in the DC vs Marvel comic run. 'The Brothers' are essentially the two multiverses combining in a megaverse.

[The Brothers](https://preview.redd.it/h5384rec8xb91.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25a8c4895d0f2ab8565805d93bf980751915def1)

[The Amalgam](https://preview.redd.it/sqp30rec8xb91.jpg?width=323&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95825ef0d2aaa983262c473855ded01c44db13cc)

Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is this: The MCU is Earth-616, but in a different multiverse. 

The MCU was originally designated as Earth-199999, but it hasn't been labelled that for some time now. It appears to me that the MCU now exists in the same state that our universe (yes us) does. Earth Prime is our designation in DC and Earth-1218 in Marvel. The same universe (as far as I can tell) in two different multiverses (and therefore the megaverse) with two different designations.

So how I see it is this. There exists the comics multiverse, and the movies multiverse. The comics one contains every comic, and the movie one contains the MCU, the Sonyverse, The Spider-verse (thanks to Venom's post credit scene), and  stuff removed from the canon like Agents of Shield.

However, the MCU exists in a crossroads of sorts. You can access it from the comics and the movies, but by different names. To the rest of the comics multiverse, it is Earth-199999. To the rest of the movies multiverse, it is Earth-616.

1657925033,Gooni135,I feel like the comic relief kinda killed Thor 4 (no spoiler),"Just want to say first that I liked the movie, it was...fine, but that's really it. Coming from Thor Ragnarok I expected a big comedic element but personally I would go as far as to say it was INCREDIBLY overdone. Not to say it wasn't funny but I feel like it took a lot of the attention away from the dark tone the film COULD have had. In simpler terms I feel like they treated this movie more like a comedy than a hero action movie. The point of comic relief is to act as a cushion for more serious sections of a movie, but there wasn't really much to take seriously. What sucks is that Christian Bale did a fanTANSTIC job, best villain we've seen since Thanos, and it's a shame that all that momentum he built up was kinda killed by certain weird jokes about hammers. I think if this film took on a little bit of a more serious tone it could've been much better. Something along the lines of how winter soldier felt. There were SOME jokes here and there but what drove the film was the plot and the action sequences and I really feel Thor 4 lacked in this area.

Loki breaks the multi verse... Looks like that is the starting point... Then Spider Man NWH doesn't reference what happened there and does its own thing with the multiverse...  Then it ends within the scope of the movie. Then What If does its own version of the Multiverse and closes the loop on it. The same thing happens in Dr. Strange MoM but it feels even more disconnected.

The only thing that seems to have an open thread at this point is Loki and I still don't know if that's the same Multiverse we see in these other entries or something entirely different.

1657893215,sora1493,Wanda's State of Mind - Psyche in Multiverse of Madness [Possible Spoilers],"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jfk35avrlqb91.gif

***Hey all!*** 

***\[Before reading further, this depicts information about Wanda in MoM - if you have not seen the film or have not watched WandaVision do not proceed further unless you do not mind spoilers or have seen the series\]***

I wanted to share some thoughts in this community as I have re-watched Multiverse of Madness just a few times since its release (both in theaters, and a few times with a couple of different friend groups who have caught up on the newer Marvel storylines). I have been following the storylines for some time, I used to be into the comics when I was younger but did not follow every plot line - I mostly have read summaries and brief notes on basically what happens chronologically across the comic series in comparison to the movies. 

**- Wanda's progression through MCU Cinema Universe:** she is introduced as a ""mutant"" initially who gained her powers from the Mind Stone, then we see her involvement in Hyrda leading her/Pietro to temporarily band with Ultron against Tony Stark for vengeance (as Stark Technologies was responsible for the military technology/equipment used that inadvertently during a strike bombed and killed Maximoff's parents). We see her introduction in Age of Ultron - and the introduction of Vision/her becoming alliances with the Avengers when Pietro dies and she realizes Ultron's true plans for destruction. I think it's really important to consider that Wanda had lost everything prior to this time in her life - from her parents to Pietro, to then losing the Avengers. This brings me to a later point - but Natalya/Steve Rogers helped to train her and tried to help her control her powers, which of course brought about the unfortunate situation in the Civil War where her powers accidentally caused the death and explosion of a building while using her telekinesis to evade a bomber from harming people at ground level during a battle that Steve encountered during the beginning of the film. Wanda goes through a lot of trauma - from being orphaned, experimented on, seen as a monster publicly due to her powers, and then forced into hiding after the conflict from Civil War. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Wanda vs. Thanos (What If?):** it was very interesting to me that Wanda became undead in the ""What If?"" spin-off and they displayed different perspectives briefly of The Scarlet Witch from an undead type variant perspective/who was still very powerful against the Avengers as an enemy. This got me thinking though before even seeing Multiverse of Madness, but after seeing End Game - Wanda displayed a huge amount of power and threat against Thanos which became a noticeable feat amongst fans, Kevin Feige confirmed her power, amongst finally displaying some level of comic-Scarlet Witch power. Doctor Strange saw countless different realities in which they only defeated Thanos according to him, but ""What If"" this was not just the case - and Strange overlooked realities in which there were alternative points in time or blind spots overlooked in his visions where Wanda/The Scarlet Witch would be able to defeat him? I do want to caveat and say, of course for writing/movie purposes, the torch was passed to Tony Stark (Iron Man) who ended up carrying it out. This decision from Strange to hand Thanos the time stone did the following sequence of events:  


1. Wanda killed Vision in order to protect Thanos from getting 
2. Thanos reverses time (killing Vision ""meant nothing"" - according to Wanda in Multiverse of Madness) and kills Vision to steal the Mind Stone
3. Thanos kills half of the universe with a snap (including herself - who disappear for many years)
4. Tony Stark reverses time - but in doing so, Natalya dies while sacrificing herself for a stone, Captain America decides to join an alternative timeline after being introduced to the Multiversal concept of time/ages in the present day, and Tony Stark passes - leading to the end of the Avengers. Wanda ends up losing her friends, her love, and her safety due to this timeline.

Alternative timeline examples: Wanda faces Thanos earlier in Infinity War (possibly uses her powers to get the Gauntlet off of him or subdue him sooner), Wanda and Vision try to face Thanos in Wakanda, and/or Wanda releases her powers from WandaVision sooner (either from killing Vision or out of fear of Vision dying/protecting Vision) that she unlocks her power to shape reality - is able to use this to counteract his stones and subdue him to where Thor shows up and kills him\*

\--

**- WandaVision Events:** there's a lot of ongoing discussion and debate still on the actions of Wanda here, I have written past posts but I will summarize that she is a grey character (this matches her character arc). This storyline felt like a remix of The House of M Storyline (will not spoil that) but a take on Wanda losing her mind and her descent into becoming ""The Scarlet Witch"". I found the series very intriguing, nostalgic, very much a toy on the psyche, and makes you wonder the lengths you would go to if you knew you had the power to alter reality. Clearly here though, we see the mental instability of Wanda slowly slip and she becomes aggressive toward Vision, even her kids at some point in her neglect of being honest with them about the legitimate chaos ensued around them from her powers, and how she brainwashes the townspeople. I do empathize with her as we do see she does not realize her powers at first but then does catch on that it is intentional and she begins to bend the dark magic to her whim while trying to maintain self-preservation of her own interests in keeping Vision and her children. Agatha is also a grey character who we learn was not all bad - though she did introduce Wanda to the Darkhold (grave mistake - but very strange and I feel will come full circle as we need questions answered there as to why Agatha had it in the first place and why/if Wanda was so dangerous she would introduce her to the Darkhold). Overall - I loved Wandavision and the slow descent into madness for Wanda after years of build-up from the Marvel films, and it showed how well-developed Wanda's character has become. Wanda was the villain of her own story and while she made it ""right"" in the end - this was only because she was ""forced"" to once Vision became suspicious, the outside world was catching on, and Agatha confronted her as a fellow witch.   


***\*A very key observation here is similar to Shang Chi's Father as well*** for those who have seen the movie\* - where his Dad became corrupted by the rings and began to hear the voices of his wife calling for his help. At the end of Wandavision, we see Wanda with the Darkhold and she hears her children calling for help. I wonder if this will tie in with each other at some point but it did foreshadow the corruption we then see in Multiverse of Madness.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Multiverse of Madness, ""The Scarlet Witch"":** I actually very much enjoyed the take on Wanda's now full descent into becoming a villain. It was not the ""best"" Marvel movie in my opinion, but it very much felt like an ""Age of Ultron"" type in-between exposition film to help characters develop a built and fill in some new plot introductions about concepts for our main characters - also similar to ""Civil War"" in the sense that Strange and Wanda are having a very personal conflict. I understand in this case where Wanda is wrong - she has clearly become corrupted by the Darkhold and has knowingly abused her Chaos Magic after knowing the events of Wandavision she still took the Darkhold from Agatha and manipulated Dark Magic to try and take America's powers, and overall has become ruthless in her pursuit to enslave Chavez for her powers so she can essentially rule being able to become a Witch of Multiversal Travel - both to claim her sons and conquer any challenge through traveling the multiverse for endless solutions to problems. I know people felt upset or either did not see Wandavision (or have not watched all past Marvel films, or know of her comic-book character arc)  know this was not a random descent to madness or villainous for Wanda's character. I also appreciated the realism in her disdain for Strange, as I believe she learned a few things which the fans then end up becoming aware of or I think can become more aware of to consider:  


1. Maybe Strange's way to win the war against Thanos was not the only way to defeat him - meaning other realities possible where Vision lives/Wanda preserves her life with The Avengers
2. Strange never considered The Book of Vishanti (he even called it a hoax and myth at certain points where it ends up being revealed as true) - this could have been a deciding factor possibly in defeating Thanos from both timelines 
3. Strange ends up becoming corrupt in multiple realities - which Wanda learns, and is likely why she calls him a hypocrite, we learn he dream walks causing an incursion, dangles him with an opportunity to be with Christine for eternity as a trick to lure his desire for love/power (""Always holding the knife""), amongst other issues revealed that he essentially breaks Multiversal concepts - I am sure the events of No Way Home/Infinity War/End Game all combined to this moment have not helped.
4. ""The Scarlet Witch"" has learned that her powers may have been enough to defeat Thanos. Her disdain for Strange based solely on this is evident - you notice during the final scenes of ""End Game"" as Wanda is both grieving, you notice that the two magical beings never interact once. Looking back to this moment, I wonder how upset Wanda may have actually been with Strange's decision to sacrifice them all (including himself) and be the master of fate essentially which brought them to this moment where Wanda has lost everyone forever.
5. Strange continuously tells her the kids aren't real - this shows how much more developed she is in her knowledge of the Multiverse and magic in areas he is not strong in/but proceeds to claim he knows it all (i.e. ""Always holding the knife""). I understand where this angers her more as she finds him condescending and hypocritical based on his events from No Way Home, and also in his pursuits to determine the fate of the Infinity War/End Game wars at the whim of his ""This is the only way decision"", Wanda probably does not trust his judgment. This coupled with her corruption, and the Darkhold (similar to Shang Chi's father - calling for help and to be saved from demons) is likely why Wanda snaps - the magical corruption, the thirst to get her children back, the battle against those who mock her ""magical"" children who actually **do** exist, and she probably really is mentally convinced that the greater good for the multiverse is to steal Chavez's powers.
6. The moment we realize Wanda basically is considered a supernatural ""God-like"" being - where Chthon had created Wundagore, The Darkhold, gifted her basically with Chaos magic - she and the audience realize more that she had the potential to stop Thanos in our universe - as did other universes using other means of magic, such as The Book of Vishanti - which Strange kept Dreamwalking anyways in ""hopes"" to find a solution to defeating Thanos and though he never did, continued to use corrupt magic. The parallels between Wanda and Strange in the film I think are very well done and in fact show that no decisions made may have been finite in the scope of the Multiverse in terms of having ""1 way"" to kill Thanos - and it also shows the possibilities within both Strange as a grey character who may be as dangerous or similar to Wanda/The Scarlet Witch.
7. The ending of the movie - without delving too much into it, I will not say what I think the fate is of Wanda but I do think her variant will have consequences play out from needing to prove her innocence in that universe due to the destruction caused by The Scarlet Witch. I also do think ""House of Harkness"" will cover the aftermath of ""Multiverse of Madness"" while looking into Agatha's past as well, and I do feel as if Wanda's ""Death"" was actually a spell or some type of self-preserving prison to keep herself captive. This reminds me of a spin on something they did similar in the comic where Wanda exiles herself temporarily due to an event that happened.
8. This is why, to me, this is similar to Age of Ultron and Civil War where it's introducing a larger foe (possible Kang, Nightmare, etc) and now that Wanda is ""dead"" there is a possibility she can be controlled or taken advantage of.

Also just want to say - loved the whole vibe of the movie. I give it a solid 8/10 (it was like a B+ for me in terms of Marvel) - I loved the visuals, the music was great, and the ""Dream Walking"" explanation scene from Mordo is one of my favorite Marvel scenes I think now of all time. Overall a very fun movie.",Marvel

He was a public figure war profiteer who went on to bash his entire industry, and spend his fortune on himself, buying fancy houses and making high tech suits of armor.

I especially loved Loki, he was my favourite villian because he was behind so much and i really enjoyed every panel he was in until he decided to play hero and sacrifice himself only to be reborn as a kid.  
I read Avengers (Aaron run) and appearently he is a villian there again and a very enjoyable one too, he is probably even better than he was before he sacrificed himself, i love his new attitude and laid back sarcasm.  


When does he really start to become a villian again? I want to read the build-up to that comic.",Marvel

1657870850,Equal-Explanation222,Is Dottie actually Emma Frost?,"After the Ms.Marvel reveal, I started thinking about some of the recent characters we’ve met in this phase. 

Since we know Billy &amp; Tommy existed in Westview, they were ‘technically’ the first mutants revealed, Kamala was the first named mutant. 

Dottie was an interesting character that intrigued many of us when WV first released. Since much of Wanda’s comic book history revolves around being a Mutant, I think this might a Easter egg hidden in plain sight.  

Some of her interactions with Wanda indicated she was somewhat aware of what was going on- which a telepath might be able to do. 

There’s also some resemblance in character design, but that could just be a coincidence.  Just a thought.",Marvel

1657862899,Crazzdude93,Captain America ww1 ideas and accuracies.,"So I'm working on a Captain America storyline where it takes place between WW1 and the year 2040 (Where he wakes up frozen). I don't want to go into much detail but in this universe, I want to make for Marvel comics all the past heroes were murdered, and these new heroes who inherit mantles of the original heroes and a few new ones take their place. One of them is a man named William Barracks who's a 16 to 18-year-old American volunteer that joined in 1916 and is a  forgotten legend that was the original Captain America before Steve Rogers who was considered the original during WW2. Now a few differences are his costume which has a sorta WW1 look with a sorta Bucky Barnes mask from the old comics, he doesn't have a shield yet he has the Star, and he later wears a new outfit in 2040 wearing a modified outfit with Captain America's shield. What I'm trying to do now is have him fight during WW1 but even though I did more research I also need help from others who can have ideas when setting this during WW1 like Accuracies and events that would tie in. The super soldier serum would exist as a small medical prototype found in a German trench that a medic uses on William after being shot, Lernäische (german for Lernaean) is a german medic and soldier who also injected himself with the prototype serum and became a red skull figure with a red skull on his helmet and in modern times wears a creepy red skull mask and has a metal arm like the winter soldier. This is a lot to take in but let me know your thoughts and ideas and what WW1 elements I could fit in. I also try to add some pictures of their WW1 and Modern looks as well at one point.",Marvel

It was one of the best selling story at the time for Marvel and of cause they made a second one the year after, titled ""Secret Wars II""

Here is where I am confused, becasue compared to the original Secret Wars in 1984 and the most recent one in 2015, Secret Wars II (1985) is a comic I find hard to buy a physical copy of.  
In every comic book store I am in, I see the first and the latest, but not the 2nd one. Even on Amazon and Ebay, it's hard to find it. So why, why have they stopped printing (I assume) the storyline?

1657818364,gene_murdoc,The 616 issue,"***(WARNING: LONG READ)*** So a lot of people have a lot of opinions on the MCU being earth 616, some good some bad but I don’t think people have touched on the big issue with the MCU being earth 616. It’s that the MCU is too different to be 616, let me elaborate. So earth 616 is supposed to be the prime dimension for marvel, all of the events happen in a very specific way and all of the characters are very specific people, I think that the MCU has strayed too far away from the source material to be that particular universe. Some examples of this would be the characters, to me the one that stands out the most is “MJ”. In earth 616 she is a redhead Caucasian girl and her name is Mary Jane Watson, in the MCU she is a lighskin black girl with the name Michelle Jones Watson. It would be one thing if they just changed what she looked like but they changed her whole name too, if this were the prime universe for marvel then she would look exactly how he does originally and she would have the same name. It’s not just her either, Taskmaster had the same problem, in the comics HIS name was Tony Masters and he was a mercenary, in the films it was Dreykov’s daughter with a name that kinda resembles the original name but not really. It would make more sense if these characters were from variant universes. The major marvel events such as civil war are too different from how they originally happened as well, I’m not saying that they should do the exact same thing but just in movie form, I’m just saying that this is a film adaptation of these characters and events so they should stay consistent with how these things transpired and who the characters are but at the same time adding their own spin on it to make it more interesting while not rewriting the whole story. I honestly don’t think that they should have made it earth 616, they should have just tried to make it it’s own universe, plus how cool would it have been if the REAL 616 was out there and it’s just like the comic universe or it IS the comic universe? That would have been so much cooler in my opinion.",Marvel

The whole movie they made multiple references to afterlives for gods and even the god that Gor killed specifically mocked him for there not being an afterlife (which seemed to be a real trigger for him back then).

* **mutant**: born with the x-gene, born with their powers (Wolverine)

* **mutate**: born non-powered, use external source to get super powers (Hulk)

**Wanda**

Wanda was born with powers as shown in Episode 8 of Wandavision. She received these powers at around puberty, a mutant milestone. She was exposed to the Mind Stone and received enhancement.

**Diagnosis:** mutant

**Pietro**

There is strong evidence to be a mutant as well. He shares the same biology being Wanda’s twin. Strucker said all human candidates died in the experiments, except the Twins. Pietro and Wanda were built differently. Seeing how no other human survived exposure to the Mind Stone, Pietro was able to survive because of his genetic makeup.

1657790410,PM_ME_YOUR_STOMACHS,Controversial opinion: Focusing on the same ~30 characters is making the Marvel Universe boring.,"The Marvel Universe is big. Very big. Yet, just like Star Wars and the Skywalker family, almost all of the comic books that have been released in the 616 universe focus on the same characters (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Blade, etc). This causes the issues to feel like there just repeats of the same event that happened five years ago. Spider-Man and MJ argue for the 200th time. Iron Man must save the day without his armour for the 50th time. Wolverine stars in his 1 millionth issue, etc.

There is enough possible content at the moment to write about for decades, without touching the usual characters.

If every issue has around 32 pages, and each individual *page* featured one Krakoa mutant (assuming there’s 200,000 of them), then that’s 6,250 issues. 

When we get to the Arakko mutants, things get much more interesting. 4 million new mutants with exciting, unseen powers gets us up to 125,000 issues.

A decent writer could make a fantastic 6-issue comic for any of these characters. Meaning that there is a possibility of at least (4,000,000 + 200,000 x 6 = ) 25,200,000 comic books worth of content for just mutants alone.

That’s not even considering all the super-powered individuals who aren’t mutants. And that’s just *one planet*.

Instead of yet another Wolverine origin story, tell me a story of a civilian mutant trying to start a new life on Arakko, or a teenager discovering their new superpowers in a city that isn’t New York, like Rio de Janeiro, London, or Lagos. Hell, I’ll even take a 6-issue event around Paste-Pot Pete.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, Marvel has an enormous universe to use. But their biggest problem is that they rarely tap into the original, and creative side of their writers.",Marvel
1657789199,kihu16,Very late to the party but just finished NWH and wanted to share my thoughts,"I did manage to avoid most spoilers up until now (aside from Andrew and Tobey) so idk how others feel about it. 

Overall, the movie was meh. I looked up ratings after and was pretty surprised to see how high they were. As far as cinema goes, it wasn't bad but the story is what ruined it for me. They pushed the ""good guy"" narrative way too far and it was beyond reason. Peter has done questionable things on an impulse in the past to try to be ""good"" and I get that it's part of his character, but putting the entire multiverse at risk to save a handful of bad guys? Knowing that even if you succeed there are infinite universes out there where they are still bad? Because May said so?? I just can't wrap my head around how doing that would be worth it no matter how much of a good guy you are. This also ruined May's character for me. The fact that before she dies she still says trying to help them was the right thing is just bs. 

Some other parts of the story were also very questionable. First, Wong? He showed up in the beginning, said keep me out of this, and that's it? You would think the actual sorcerer supreme would know or care a little more about the multiverse breaking. And then there's MJ. Went from a logical but skeptical person to immediately fully trusting Peter and not even questioning any of his actions. Especially the scene where she and Ned are watching the news after May dies and they're sitting there still wondering if they should push the button. I know it's all part of the story and it's what needs to happen but it's such a reach in terms of how the characters and normal people would react. Also, the scene where Peter traps Strange using math was extremely cringe. Yeah they're trying to show Peter combining his powers with his other skills but still... that was just bad. 

The last half of the movie, I'm going to be honest, I had to pause and have quite a few drinks before finishing. The writing was a little clunky but I think it fits kind of well with all 3 spider mans. The final fight was pretty boring and just as you'd expect. A typical hero team up where they struggle at some point but get it together in the end. However, I did really enjoy watching Peter (Tom) beat the crap out of Norman. It was such a powerful moment and one of the scenes that actually felt genuine and not just there to move the story along. 

Overall, I would've liked the movie much more had they not pushed the good guy narrative so hard. And I'm going to be bold and say that the only reason this movie is rated as well as it is, is because of the actors. I mean, even I had my giddy moments seeing all the villains and spiders come in.",Marvel
1657785948,TheIncredibleHarry,I have a unpopular opinion about Hulk that should be common knowledge.,"I’m tired of hearing this so here we go…Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk looks nothing like a ape. Hulk has the same facial features  
and bone anatomy as any human it’s just that his skull structure is proportionally exaggerated.

Yes Hulk’s brown ridge, chin, and upper lip are supposed to be over exaggerated. Hulk and Jack Kirby purposely made Hulk like this because they took some inspiration from Frankenstein’s for Hulk’s physical design.

Some people still say because of this he looks like an ape and well anatomically that’s STILL not true. The WHOLE skull of a gorilla differs from regular humans &amp; Hulk’s skull for so many reasons.

1). Gorillas have a large sagittal crest on the top of their skulls which give them the cone head appearance. Hulk doesn’t have a gorilla cone head lol Hulk’s skull shape is the same as a human just slightly sloped and the brown ridge is larger

2). Gorillas have proportionately big canine teeth but Hulk doesn’t. His teeth are usually portrayed as being proportionally smaller than regular humans in comparison to his overall face.

3). Gorillas have prognathism giving them a protruding face but Hulk doesn’t have that. His upper lip is longer than the average human’s but his face is still flat like a humans and doesn’t protrude extremely.

4). Gorillas have receding chins but Hulk’s chin is pronounced.

The only thing that you could say is ape like about Hulk are his mannerisms but that’s comic accurate 🤷🏾‍♂️.",Marvel

1657747146,JamesPlayzReviews,My Problem With Everyone Making Fun of Mr. Fantastic,"Now as we all know the movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness recently came out and if you don't know that, have you been living under a rock and I'm being serious with that question?

Anyway I digress, in the movie Mr. Fantastic tells Wanda, Black Bolt's only power that being his voice in which Wanda simply removes the hole in Black Bolt's face containing his mouth. Black Bolt freaks out and blows his own brains out but with a sound instead of a gun, Mr. Fantastic horrified by what Wanda did freaks out and tries to grab Wanda but she simply shreds him and turns him into cottage cheese.

Now as most people know Mr. Fantastic has been getting ""memeed on"" so to speak with there being memes calling him the dumbest man in the world or saying that he forgot that he is the smartest man alive. At first I didn't mind these memes as I thought that everyone was right and Mr. Fantastic made a dumb decision, which I'm not saying didn't make ***A*** dumb decision meaning one but I'm saying that the decision to tell Wanda about Black Bolt was only semi-dumb. You see for those of you who weren't really paying attention to the situation and just wanted a fight, Mr. Fantastic thought he could simply intimidate Wanda into surrendering. Being that he found Strange to be more dangerous than Wanda he though Wanda would be a walk in the park compared to Strange. So as an intimidation attempt he told Wanda what Black Bolt could do to Wanda, as we all know Wanda was not at all intimidated and took away Black Bolt's face hole making him blow up from the inside out.

Now where Mr. Fantastic makes the dumb decision is in what he does next, instead of being calm about the situation he freaks out and you can see it in his face as soon as Black Bolt dies. Reed looks like he just lost not only his best friend (which he did), but his most powerful ally (which he kind of did I mean Captain Marvel wasn't much help) and so decides he can maybe restrain Wanda but she sees it coming and kills him. Also I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared or sad when your friend is brutally murdered in front of you but I'm saying if you have bigger fish to fry (metaphorically speaking) then you should fry the fish then mourn. Also just because your the smartest man alive doesn't mean you don't sometimes make dumb decisions or just not have feelings, and remember feelings make us all act dumb sometimes.

Anyway I'm glad I got that out of the way.",Marvel

1657739347,EntertainmentBoy,Ms. Marvel show review [Spoilers],"So I just saw episode 6 of Ms. Marvel and here are my thoughts. 

It was great, even though there were some problems I thought this was the best episode of the season. Why weren't any of the other episodes as good as this one?

The action was top-notch, with good CGI on Ms. Marvel's powers and Kamran's powers.  Kamran's powers are soo beautiful and cool to look at, they are blue and soo comics accurate. He uses his powers almost like cosmic blasts. Kamala Khan's powers are the same, but in a different color, she uses them differently, almost like forming 
constructs, like Green Lantern, but not as complex. The way she uses them in the show is such a call back to her powers in the comics, she even says embiggen in this episode when she kicks ass using them to do awesome things. Ms. Marvel isn't comics-accurate though, I love all the Pakistani heritage and representation, she is a hero for that type of culture and it's great and comics-accurate. But in the show Bruno, who I love, he's such a great character. 

He says in the episode that Kamala is a mutant and that her powers are a mutation. That doesn't make any sense at all because just last episode they were talking about her being a Gin. This whole season, her heritage and powers were explained to us as a Gin. Kamala is a Gin who gets her powers from the Noor Dimension. But now in episode 6, she's a mutant. 

That means this whole show has just been a big waste of time! Marvel spent most of the time trying to fit Ms. Marvel into the cosmic world of the MCU saying that she's connected to Captain Marvel somehow in some way. When she is not, her powers seem more magic in the show. This adaptation hasn't been working out, so they call her a mutant now. It's so messed up, and very confusing, how is her powers a mutation if she gets it from the Noor dimension. She can't even use them without the bangle, and since she's a mutant does that mean her heritage is too like her great grandmother or Kamran's mother. Is Kamran a mutant too, because that also doesn't make sense. He has the same powers as Kamala. 

Mutants are born with their powers and they all have different abilities, not the same. Also, mutant powers aren't inherited either. Ms. Marvel can also shape-shift too, which I think is also from the comics, she shape-shifts into Captain Marvel in episode 6, what's up with that? This whole show overall has just been a big convoluted mess. Episodes 1,2 were great, episodes 3,4 were ok, and episodes 5,6 were the best of the season, but also just ruined Kamala khans character. I hope Captain Marvel 2 can explain her a little better than this show did. I also hope we get to see Bruno again, he's awesome. Also, the red dagger character is good too, I want to see him again. 

Her parents continue to be a great addition to her character. I loved that her mother made her superhero suit, she looked great. Her father also gave her, her superhero name with that amazing speech that made my heart smile. Damage control was soo bad, I was soo annoyed with them this whole season. So far to me, this is the fourth best Marvel Disneyplus show. It was good in some parts, but very confusing and not comics accurate, which has caused the story to suffer.  I usually don't care about marvel not being comics accurate, but when the story starts to suffer, because of the changes they made to a character that's when it's a big problem.",Marvel

1657717350,Ordinary_Schmuck,Quick Thoughts on Ms. Marvel (+Finale),"Alright, now for the season finale of *Ms. Marvel.* And it’s...not great.

Now, on paper, the idea of Kamala going out of her way to save a colored powered individual from a corrupt system of authority is a great one. And, at times, it kind of works. That is, it works when it’s Kamala and Kamran, with Kamala doing her own damage control (ha) against Kamran’s attempts to really hurt people. *That* results in some fun and tense action. When it comes to Kamala’s friends trying to mess with Damage Control like they’re meddling kids in an episode of *Scooby-Doo,* it’s a little too silly. Like, nothing that they’ve done should have worked.

But the main issue that “No Normal” has isn’t anything that happens in this episode. It’s everything that happened in the series that builds up to it. Kamran having powers isn’t really a bad idea, but how he got them involved this long and convoluted process that, when you sit down and think about it, doesn’t make much sense. It’s almost as if it would have been better if he had powers to begin with. Maybe through something like, I don’t know, through a terrigen gas bomb that gave random people in the city superpowers and forcing Kamala to deal with them? Something that happened in the comics? And that you could use future series/movies to explain why such an event happened in the first place?

Just a thought.

And, hey, if they *did* go the terrigen gas route, it would also do a great job in building up Damage Control as the final threat. They barely got any focus in this series, all because all the attention went to the schmucks who died in the previous episode. If we spent time with Sargent What’s-Her-Face, dealing with other powered individuals and being hostile to the ones that are “coincidentally” people of color, then we’d have a decent villain that makes for the perfect antagonist for Kamala, given both characters backgrounds. But, no, we needed to have this completely unnecessary story-line smooshed into the series just so we can establish why Ms. Marvel is powerful enough to be an Avenger. By the way, can we *please* stop this idea that a hero needs to save the world to establish why they should be an Avenger? It hurt *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,* it hurt *Moon Knight,* and it *destroyed Ms. Marvel.* A hero doesn’t need to save the world to prove that they’re worth being one of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther’s solo movies were about them fighting villains who’s motivations were to give dangerous weapons to others. It’s not world ending, but it could still do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent people. And that’s fine.

Kamala didn’t need to fight these inter-dimensional beings who could potentially destroy everything in getting back home. Not when fighting Damage Control could be just as important and lead to an incredible message about a corrupt system in law enforcement. The world doesn’t need to be saved when helping a small number of people could do just as much good. After all...

“Whoever saves one person, it is as if he has saved all of mankind.”-Yusuf Khan. From the comics. Which do in fact matter.

As a whole, the finale’s a mess. Which makes sense because the *whole series* is a mess too.

As far as I can tell, *Ms. Marvel* nails the spirit of the character, [but it failed the most important aspect of her.](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/ordinaryschmuck/686229940763557888?source=share)

And I *do* love the characters (expect for the boring and forgettable villains). Hell, I’ve kept saying that the best parts of *Ms. Marvel* are the moments that make these characters feel human, especially the moments involving Kamala’s friends and family and the Muslim/Arabic heritage. If this was just a series about an over imaginative girl who learned to appreciate her heritage and the people around her, it’d get an easy A for effort. But it isn’t. It’s a superhero series that tries way too hard to be grand and epic when something small and personal would have fit much better.

So, as is, I’d say *Ms. Marvel’s* a...5/10? Maybe a 6/10 if I wanted to be nice?

I don’t know. Phase Four of the *MCU* really is a mess, and it’s evident that *Marvel Studios* are focusing more on quantity than quality. Nothing they’ve made is really *that bad,* but they definitely need to take a break, take a breath, and reconsider what fans want from this franchise.",Marvel

What I don’t understand is why are they both called Thor or more importantly, why doesn’t Jane Foster have her own Asgardian name for when she turns into her superhero version? I thought Thor was a single person whereas now it seems to be more of a type of character from Asgard who can wield certain weapons like Mjolnir and Stormbreaker.

Is Jane Foster/Mighty Thor like Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk or what am I missing here?

1657650203,VeganArmieHammer,Is it just me or most of the current Marvel comics are pretty good?,"Maybe I'm in a good mood lately but I feel like the comics are firing on most cylinders right now. 

On the X-Men side we've got Immortal X-Men, which is honestly fantastic and for my money much better than Hickman's ongoing. X-Men Red is excellent (Ewing never misses), and Legion of X and Duggan's X-Men are pretty good too. 

Then we have Jed Mackay consistently knocking it out of the park with Moon Knight, Strange and, most surprisingly, Iron Cat (though that's only a surprise for those who haven't read his Black Cat series, because the guy writes the best Felicia).

Captain America by Kelly and Lanzig is just starting but already feels like the best Cap run since Brubaker. Steve's voice in this is perfect, and there's an almost Hickman-esque vibe to the complex plot. 

What else? Venom is excellent when Ewing is writing (Ewing never misses x 2), and Ram V's Carnage is a real nice neo-noir crime story meets cosmic horror. And speaking of horror, Percy's Ghost Rider is one of the best horror comics on stands these days. 

I dropped Cates' godawful Thor ongoing, but Gronbekk's Jane Foster and the Mighty Thor is giving me the epic, mythology-driven Thor series I wanted. Shame it's just a mini.

1657621244,KorEl555,No Way Home question - spoiler,"This has probably been asked and talked about, but I was trying my best to avoid spoilers until No Way Home came to Redbox.

Spoilers again

By the way, did Tobey Spider-Man have anything to say about how the MMU Jameson looks almost exactly like his Jameson, just with less hair? (MCU is Marvel Comics Universe; why are we using it for Cinematic? I'm invoking Marvel Movie Universe.)

And when did Peter turn 18? Or is the age of adulthood in New York younger than 18. Because Pete could sue Jameson into oblivion if he was still a minor.

So did Strange's spell wipe all the electronic devices of any image or video of Peter? Maybe he said, and I wasn't paying that close attention. Because I imagine Ned and MJ looking through their phones, and finding pictures of this guy they have no memory of.

And then Peter walks into her place of work, and they're not ""Who are you? Why do I have hundreds of pictures of you?""

Not to mention, Jameson still would have the video of Mysterio revealing Spider-Man's true identity.

And that's still not to mention everything in print. MJ doesn't have pictures of her and Pete surrounding her mirror in her bedroom?",Marvel
1657616904,Kordben,Lately the Black Cat has became the best written character within MARVEL comics.,"I'm a long time Spider-Man fan and felt really sad when they made Felicia the new Kingpin (Queenpin) because it was horrible writing all over the place after Superior Spider-Man. She was always a thief and an anti hero and one of Peter Parker's closest friend. Making her act the way she did during that time period was really inconsistent to her core personality and standards she set for herself.

That is why it was so heartwarming to see how the ASM Vol5. (ASM 2018) reestabilished her position within the universe.

*Processing img 1ij763n413b91...*

From this moment Felicia played crucial part (again) in every major spidey event during the run of the series in one way or another. 

Important to mention here that during Hunted event we get to see how she processing the fact that she can remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man and everything that comes with it. It was unusual read because I rarely seen the character going so deep with her own emotions, or just overall in MARVEL comics it's not usual for side characters but I'm glad it happened and we get to see what is happening to her during this time.

*Processing img 96gk120k13b91...*

The issue was really good to read to see what is happening and how she tries to get over it. It must be difficult to realise that you was in a relationship with a guy years ago then it keep happening all over again and it's all like yesterday. As I said writers did an amazing job to reestabilish her and Pete's frienldy relationship and they did an amazing job doing so meanwhile laying the foundations to her ongoing series (12 issue in 2019 and a relaunch in 2020).

If you did not read it I sincerely advise to do so because it's really fun and engaging series. (art style is so much better during relaunch but the first series also had a charm). Dr. Strange, Fantastoc Four and many more are on her list.

[ Black Cat Vol1. #9 ](https://preview.redd.it/z109tecj23b91.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9af12afeb58b3e0e4fba7eb3e68f67b28fd7cf2)

The 2 series shown how **vulnerable, thoughtful, sassy, resourceful and brave** she can be and not just because we never seen these sides of her character explored by this much. Exploring her relationship with her master, the Black Fox and her gang is fun while also we are getting to know more about her past which is further explored in the current ongoing run, The Iron Cat.

Elegant, deep, action packed, has lot's of heart and many other words that are barely enough to describe how Black Cat was reestabilished in the past 2 years as one of the best written character in the market you could find while making Felicia Hardy the most fleshed out hero lately.

**Felicia Hardy is a much more fleshed out character right now than ever before and easily outshines many mainstream characters that has way bigger fanbase and story to work with.**

Her books are usually those gems readers like me are looking for.

During her run in 2019 we can see her hanging out occasionally with her Mother and seeing her face with Odessa, a former love interest. It helps us to understand Felicia and her family, surroundings more.   
The following relaucnh in 2020 ties into the ongoing event so she has a job to free Dr. Strange from the prison Knull, the King in Black. 

[Black Cat V2. #1](https://preview.redd.it/cxinn9dr53b91.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0bf6aad4f6ed0e2577001ec22c0e414b2947530)

We can see her succeeding and she did helps Dr. Strange escape from Knull's prison to help turn the tides in the war while also managed to overcame the extradimensional powers that the Asgardian Magic offered her (thanks to the fact that she do not desire to control and mnipulate others the way she would be able with the  magic). 

[Black Cat V2. #3](https://preview.redd.it/o6w5wii263b91.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a66b12f14c410a07917e08a3172ff1158f9645b)

As closorue the the first series we get to see how it's ending following the King in Black tie in. What Felicia has to do is basically a choice. Her mentor who raised and trained her seeks immortality thus makes a deal with a demon to gain immortality. All he has to offer to the demon is Manhattan. This is where the Black Cat has to make the ultimate choice of her life

[ Black cat Vol 2. #6 Felicia sacrifices the man she owes her life to save Manhattan and everyone within it.](https://preview.redd.it/xqhizmq183b91.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28dcf6548778042632d9fbb11b29c8f48985003b)

What follows as the last arc of the series is the biggest job she has ever taken. During teh arc she managed to outsmart Nick Fury Jr. more than once while having action packed sceens when the stakes are higher for her than ever before. Having her trying to collect the Infinity Gems bound individuals is no small job at all while she will have to deal with both Fury and Nighthawk (Batman). She manages to win at the end obviously and reaching her goal with those people while getting out alive from the actions.

After the series ended Villa joins MacKay on art continuing their crushingly good Black Cat  storytelling for a one-shot Mary jane &amp; Black Cat issue tying into the last arc of the previously mentioned SPider-Man arc ""Beyond"".

What unfolds in this issue is a fun team-up between Mary Jane and Black  Cat. The utter joy of this issue lies in the fact that these two aren’t  jealous of one another or played against each other. Instead, they are  working together to ensure Peter doesn’t get hurt while also bonding  along the way. In fact, there’s a rather touching final scene between  the two that establishes their mutual respect, how Mary Jane has dealt  with competing with other girls, and a strong sense of understanding of  each character. 

*Processing img 9aly8j8pa3b91...*

MacKay writes both characters in a natural and realistic way. He also  never puts Mary Jane in a position that’s too outlandish for someone who  isn’t a superhero. The plot moves along quickly with lots of surprises,  nods to Spidey villains, and more. It’s packed with content.  

ASM #87 written also by Jed MacKay puts heavy focus on the rehabilitation of Peter by his friends Steve Rogers and Felicia Hardy. MacKay has a firm grasp on Peter’s dynamic with both Felicia and Cap;  the former cares for him enough to know that he can’t suit up as Spidey  again without relearning his web-slinging ways, while the latter’s  worked side by side with him as an Avenger and knows how to push him  when needed.   
Both Peter and Felicia have been able to move more into being great friends that each can turn to since they know both their superhero and  personal identities on a different level than others in their respective lives. Understanding both sides of Peter, Felicia showed she understood that Peter can’t be his same reckless guy by just going back to being Spider-Man like he would normally after recovering enough from such an injury. 

I honestly have high hopes that she will be important character of the Spider-Man series as well having a blast already with her new ongoing series, The Iron Cat where she teams up with Tony Stark against a returning individual fromFelicia's past.

Jed MacKay has revitalized the Black Cat character and elevated her to new heights. With Iron Cat we will see her shine once again and I do hope that new Spider-Man run will be able to use her newfound directions and popularity. Who knows what the future brings to her. She can show up in the next Spider-Man game too and fans pretty much want's to see her in the next Spider-Man movie.",Marvel

I couldn't find the dimensions of Miljnor so I improvised. using the formula ρ=m/v where m=19186.957251g (from a 1991 Marvel “Thor’s Hammer” trading card that states Mjolnir weighs exactly 42.3 pounds, [here](https://urbandud.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/detail-128-thors-hammer.jpg?w=550)), and ρ ≈ 2.13 *g*/*cm**^(3)* (from the NC state article, [here](https://news.ncsu.edu/2013/02/wms-mjolnir/)), I determined the volume of Miljnor is  ≈ 9007.961. The densest element in the universe is osmium with a density of 22.59 *g*/*cm****^(3)****.* Fallowing the formula m=vρ and inserting our data the mass of an osmium Miljnor would be approximately  203489.83g, or 448lbs 10oz. with the current price of osmium being about $400/oz excluding labor cost the hammerhead alone in July 2022 would cost $2,871,157.2 or  € 2,867,352.92. that being said it is 3 am and I am sleep deprived so feel free to check my math",Marvel

1657566704,Antman269,Theory: The MCU is a franchise within the comics universe.,"Watching The Boys gave me an idea. 

It was established in Multiverse of Madness that the main MCU is Earth-616, meaning it is part of its own multiverse and it has no relation to the comics. 

America Chavez’s existence basically confirms this since there is supposed to only be one of her, and yet there is both a movie and comics version.

In The Boys, there are movies based on all of the superheroes that are clearly not accurate to what really happened.

In my theory, the MCU is a franchise of movies and shows created in the actual 616 comics universe. The X-Men franchise and other non-MCU Marvel movies were other attempts from different studios to adapt all the characters, but the MCU is the most successful one, even though it is not very faithful to how events really happened in the comics (Which is real life to them)

It would also be made a decade or two in the future from where the Marvel comics universe is now to explain how filmmakers know things that they shouldn’t, such as Spider-Man’s identity, since it is very much possible that people eventually learn of these things.

It would be like all those bio-pics about real people that get made in real life, but not very faithful to what really happened. People in the Marvel universe would wanna make movies and shows about their real life heroes. They probably sell insanely well.",Marvel

1657527492,Kordben,I really hope after Thor Love and Thunder writers and directors will try to put more quality into their movies and less jokes. Spoiler free.,"I loved the movie, i read the comics about Gorr and The Mighty Thor the day they were released so I really anticipated this movie. 

The concept and the build up was amazing. Every scene with Gorr in it was amazing and frightful at the same time. 

I will say it: Gorr's build up and execution as a charavter portrayed by Christan Bale was phenomenal. The best villain of MCU so far.

But every other scene in the movie with the slightest of funs, jokes and frivolous approach did no good to the movie but harmed it. Why is it so difficult to create a movie in MCU where people try to act somewhat serious in most of the time.

It's not juts children who watch the movie and even they can accept if the stakes are extremely high.  
Just look at Infinity War and Endgame. Movies were high rated for numerous reasons for a reason and it's not the blatant, forced humor and jokes that makes the movie look worse than what it is.

I had the same feeling with Multiverse of Madness. Tony Stark was the snarky figure who always shot jokes on point and this type of personality isn't exactly fittting for Dr. Strange but luckily it wasn't as much as it was in Thor yet the movie was still weak and mostly was carried by the fantastic Elizabeth Olsen who played her role extremely well and the ymanaged to make her really terrific.

The same goes for Love and Thunder. When you see Gorr you are watching an amazing movie.  
Natalie Portman's role was also great but they could have used her better (less childish and more serious after knowing what is goin on with her).

I do not want to complain because the Movie was fine, it wasn't bad but for fucks sake please reduce the amount humor and joke and childish element you out into these movies. 

It well help if you keep humor and jokes on level and don't let it to ruin the movie.",Marvel
1657525676,inklingboi08,Fun fact: The Japanese Spider-Man series led to the creation of Power Rangers.,"Under a 4 year licensing deal with Toei Company (yes, THAT Toei, who's animation company makes such greats as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and One Piece), the next series they produced following Supaidaman was Battle Fever J. It is now known as the 3rd Super Sentai series, but back then it was considered the first, ignoring the creations of Shotaro Ishinomori that were Himitsu Sentai Goranger and JAKQ Dengekitai due to licensing rights. Shotaro Ishinomori also created Kamen Rider, a sister series to Super Sentai, both of which continue to this day and are part of a genre called tokusatsu, which not only includes superhero productions but kaiju movies such as Godzilla and Gamera. Battle Fever J was also the first Sentai series to feature a giant robo/mecha, or what we in the west know as a Zord/Megazord. With the success of Battle Fever J and the other Marvel produced shows Denshi Senttai Denjiman and Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan, the Super Sentai franchise was able to continue as it does to this day. Haim Saban, while in Japan on a business trip, spotted the 8th (6th at the time) Super Sentai series, Choudenshi Bioman, on TV. He was like, ""I can make money off of this by dubbing it over!"" and so, 7 years later, in 1992, filming for the American segments of the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers began, taking stock footage from the 16th (14th at the time) Super Sentai series, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger. Fun fact, Stan Lee also saw a Sentai series whilst in Japan one time, but when he brought it to the network they turned it down. So somewhere in this ever expanding multiverse there's a world where Stan Lee created Power Rangers and it was created way before the 90s. Anyway, the suits stuck for the next two seasons, with the only elements they took from the consecutive Sentai being the mecha from Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger for seasons 2 and 3 respectively as well as the white ranger suit coming from Dairanger. The Alien Rangers of Aquitar were also adapted from the Kakurangers. For the most part, Power Rangers has continued to adapt from Sentai, although not entirely in order and jumping around a bit in recent years.

TL;DR: The Japanese Spider-Man series was part of a licensing deal with marvel that sparked 3 Super Sentai seasons, which helped boost the already rapidly growing popularity so much that Haim Saban saw it in Japan, and 7 years later took footage from these series (legally of course) to dub over and create Power Rangers.",Marvel

I've been seeing quite a bit of discussion around this particular topic of late. I personally think the Marvel multiverse as a whole is better, but I can absolutely see why people would prefer The Boys over Marvel. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that The Boys seasons one through three are better than most Marvel content. Of course, ""which is better"" is simply opinion and there is no wrong answer. 

However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that The Boys highlights a massive problem in the MCU: no real mature content. They did a damn fine job of making it work for phase 1-3, and I commend them for that. However, those of us that have been around since the first Iron Man in 08 are now in our 30's and 40's. We simply don't want a strict limit of PG or PG-13. We're grown ass adults. I get that they're trying to appeal to the younger generation to perpetuate the Marvel brand, but as a loyal fan I'm feeling a bit abandoned. I'm not saying everything Marvel has to be R rated, but please throw us a friggin bone Marvel! This problem is only going to get worse as time goes on.

The dialogue overall in this.....HORRIBLE. I mean it seems like the script barely got two drafts in before they starting filming, I mean the writing is just cringey af and hardly feels like how people actually talk, and the delivery of all this dialogue...bad man.

Carlton Drake also sucks as a villain. He is not scary.....at all. I mean it's the crap writing and Riz Ahmed is the least intimidating actor they could have possibly found.

1657473848,Eupatorus,Why does Marvel seem to be squandering their Warhammer 40k license?,"I was intrigued when Marvel took over the license for the WH40k universe a couple of years ago. I assumed they would make a real push for it in the way that they do with Star Wars and to a lesser degree the Alien/Predator franchise (which they acquired around the same time if I recall correctly). Star Wars is a juggernaut of course, but Alien and Predator are probably on par with WH40k as far as fandom/popularity goes and they are getting plenty of titles.

Yet so far there's only been two short mini-series (*Marneus Calgar* and *Sisters of Battle*) in two years. Both were pretty decent (I enjoyed them anyway) and I keep checking previews for more 40k titles but they aren't happening.

What's the deal? 40K has a rich, lore heavy universe that just seems ripe to be explored and fleshed out in comics. It's got a built in fan base in the people that play the tabletop game (I used to for many years, no time anymore) and even more fans that just play the various video games.

I just assumed when Marvel acquired the rights that they were going to run with it and really build up a Marvel 40k comics universe in the way that's never been done before, or *at least* do a mini-series for each of the different armies/factions. So far though, practically nothing!

Does anyone have any news or insight on why Marvel just acquired the license but is now just sitting on it? Why would they bother? Is there something I don't know going on? Simply abandoned for low sales? Did I miss something?

This means that they maintained the enchantment to only be moved by the worthy (which is explained away by Thor having Mjolnir “protect her”). My issue stands with that she can move and operate the hammer as if it never were destroyed (with the exception of being able to break it apart on command). Thor then is able to lift the hammer in its reassembled state, so when Hela destroyed it why did he act like his weapon was gone forever? The pieces were right there, clearly still enchanted, and able to be reformed and wielded by him. Did the hammer decide it didn’t like Thor anymore? He had to forge Stormbreaker because his hammer was broken, but Jane was able to just pick up the pieces and use them, why didn’t he? Did he just decide that the hammer wasn’t worth using anymore?

Wish granting Eternity: 
The movie establishes that Thor knows that Eternity exists, heck even Valkyrie knew about it. Granted you need the Bifrost to get there, so Thor wouldn’t have been able to access Eternity until the end of Infinity War, but directly after the Snap Thanos destroys the Infinity Stones and retires. Thor shows up and pops his head off, all well and good, wouldn’t this be the perfect time to go and wish everyone back? The stones are gone, Thanos is dead, there is apparently no one guarding Eternity (Unless Gorr killed the guards off-screen, which even if he did I’m sure the remaining heroes post-snap could probably handle any resistance) Thor could go in and wish everyone back, wish Thanos never snapped, or really any number of counter wishes. Instead Thor waits 5 years because he…forgot? He didn’t feel like it? Would rather partake in time travel shenanigans?

Thor can grant Thor powers:
I was under the impression that Jane was using Mjolnir as the source of her “Thor power”, but apparently Thor can just grant his powers to anyone? Not even a single person either, he can grant his powers to just over a dozen children. He did specify that it was temporary, but it felt like it was because he didn’t want super powered kids running around, not out of lack of ability to give them permanently. Was Thor only able to do this because he held the bolt? How did he know the bolt could do this? Why did the bolt work for him at all? You would think someone like Zeus would have a similar “worthy” enchantment on his greatest weapon, or at the very least a “only function for me” enchantment. So I’ll assume Thor can just hand these abilities out willy nilly, I know shooter mcpokeysticks and redhead twistythighs would certainly benefit from some Thor power. Even if he can only do it temporarily, why not give everyone a Thor boost before battle?

I have other issues, but these three seemed like the largest glaring problems that contradict other lore already set up by the other movies. I’m curious what you folks think or if you have theories on how/why these plot holes actually work. Thanks for reaching the end of my rant!",Marvel

1657427423,I-Like-Kuminga-Lot,The MCU has changed forever since the release of Disney+,"
So with Disney+ becoming a streaming service the dynamic of the MCU has forever changed. Disney+ is trying to compete with other streaming services like Netflix and the only way to compete is to push out new content which leads to new subscribers. The Disney+ content is coming like tsunamis. 

As you are seeing with Netflix, after a certain point the content is just not as good because of dilution. And for other reasons as well. With Netflix there are so many shows and movies but rare Ozarks or Stranger Things. With the *MCU*, Disney+ is going to pump Agatha and other shows to keep the subscribe count up. They certainly can afford to. Some shows may hit or miss, but they will exist whether you like it or not. 

So picture Netflix, except all their Netflix original shows and movies are connected. With some exceptions, but I personally dont like to blend characters from shows to movies with the exception of cameos. 

For example Wandavision is connected to DS: MoM. Ms. Marvel is connected to The Marvels. The Disney+ shows are now a pipeline to the movies. This leads to occasional forms of dilution. Was it really Doctor Strange’s sequel? Similar to Captain America 3, except now incorporate Disney+ content as well. I personally think there should be boundaries between Disney+ and MCU movies. Only time will tell. So yeah Disney+ is a streaming service and cash rules everything around MCU.",Marvel

Origin story, secret villain/switcheroo, real villain with similar powers pretty much

WandaVision - Origin of The MCU Scarlett Witch, SWORD/that one sword agent guy are made out to be the villains,
Agatha is revealed to be the real villain and uses magic.

Falcon and the Winter Soldier - Origin of the new Captain America, Karli is the proposed villain with a bunch of goons who have the super soldier serum like bucky (captain america’s sidekick), the Sharon Carter is revealed to be the real big bad!

Hawkeye - origin of the new Hawkeye, Jack, an equally if not better swordsman and Echo(i forget her name) are the proposed villains, it is revealed Kates mom is working for kingpin and is the real villain whos been pulling strings!

Moonknight - origin of the MCU Moonknight, harrow is the villain, but really hes just (trying to become) the avatar to a different god like Mark/Steven/Jake, oh my gosh!!! Its revealed Khonshu is manipulating him and is a bad guy!!! Woahhhhh

Now this is what really upsets me

MS MARVEL. Fuck man, ive loved this show, totally thought people have been taking it too seriously. Its a fun watch and ive especially loved her collecting pieces that mean something to her and incorporating them into her new suit. Love it. Have loved the history and culture we’ve been getting. But this god damn last episode “kamran” *dies* and HE GETS THE SAME FUCKING POWERS AS KAMALA. Fuck me. For once FOR FUCKING ONCE, MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL. 

Loki was originalish but in my opinion the show was a trash heap, weird poorly done Bi representation, poor acting in spots, they still did the stupid ass secret villain thing (that weird council then OOP nvm its just kang). Theres that really weird thing with loki wanting to fuck himself from another universe then to having spider-man consider his variants brothers.

Im just so tired of it all. I love the movies more than almost anything but for the love of god Disney Marvel couldnt make a decent show if its entire existence depended on it.

Hell i bet the daredevil season 4 will go like this:
- Matt Murdock inexplicably in new black and Red suit
- foggy and Karen in the first 3 episodes then disappear into the background of the season
- Echo is proposed to be the villain
-Echo kicks the shit out of daredevil 
-Matt learns who she is and her connection to kingpin
-they team up through common interest
-Bullseye comes back for revenge, beats Matt again, echo reverses the scales, daredevil and echo take him down in a team up cool collaboration of their senses",Marvel

1657414741,DoomTyr,IMO Iron Man and Spider-Man have a somewhat toxic relationship in the MCU.,"I have multiple reasons as to why I think this. When they first met in Civil War Peter is starstruck at meeting his hero and Tony takes him to his room to have a chat on him being Spider-Man and needing his help. Peter didn't want to go until Tony decided to blackmail him by telling his Aunt May everything if he didn't come, forcing him to go to protect his identity. He is then bribed with a fancy hotel room and a new suit for Peter to use in the fight clouding Peter's judgment on the whole thing. I'm assuming he didn't really tell Peter the whole story with the accords, which goes against many things Spider-Man is, and only that Captain America went rogue. So bringing Peter, a literal fourteen year old, into a battle between the Avengers isn't something any sane adult would do. Even if they are stronger than most of the heroes there.

Onto Homecoming, Peter is dropped off back at his apartment where two months go by with both Happy and Tony ignoring him. During that time Peter was doing his Spider-Man gig like always until he discovered the Vulture and his alien tech. Is rescued by Iron Man from drowning and the two have a talk on Peter taking on this guy. Tony says this kind of stuff was below their pay grade which is something Spider-Man would never excuse after Uncle Ben. He also happens to mention the voice mails Peter leaves them. So he has the time to listen to whatever Peter sends but can't send any kind of reply back?

It's then shown Tony isn't in the suit but somewhere else at a fancy gathering and not much worried about the Vulture situation. Fast forward sometime and Ned hacks into the multimillion dollar suit built by Tony Stark himself allowing Peter to use all kinds of features he didn't know about. One of those features happen to be an instant kill mode. Why would Tony give a teenager an easier way to kill someone, and an easy way for them to hack to use it?

Later Spider-Man is at the ferry putting a stop to a weapons deal of Vultures when the FBI get a jump on him and the criminals allowing Adrian to run off to suit up. Ferry gets sliced in half and Iron Man comes to save the day. He then meets Peter again blaming him for the whole incident and telling him he was the one that put the FBI on it, telling Peter everyone thought he was crazy bringing in a fourteen year old to fight.

Firstly Peter can't be fully blamed for this as Tony failed to inform him the FBI would be involved. Secondly, why would Tony involve the FBI, there's no way they were trained to deal with criminals using alien tech because Vulture is the one to capitalize on it. Peter was much more aware on what kind of danger he was facing and almost took down the operation if the FBI didn't intervene. Thirdly, did Tony tell other people who Spider-Man is? We know Happy and Pepper did but who else? Who else in higher power can put Peter in danger if his secret got out.

Tony then wants the suit back with Peter saying he was nothing without it, having the idea forced in his head he wouldn't be good enough because of Tony. He was already Spider-Man for six months before he met Tony and two months with the the suit which wasn't any much different from his old one till he hacked it. He was Spider-Man, not Tony. To rub in some salt he makes Peter walk home in dirty pajamas from a garage bin or else he would have had to journey home in his underwear. Couldn't have used some of your billions of dollars to by some decent clothes for him to go home in?

Peter feels like crap and blames himself because his hero dumped all the guilt onto him. At the end Peter is picking up by Happy, who admitted his wrong doings and forever grateful to Peter finally giving him respect he should've given in the first place. Tony takes some credit in Peter taking down the Vulture saying it was a good lesson for him. Was the lesson that he didn't need your suit to stop him? Tony then bribes him again with a better suit similar to his and a spot on the Avengers, which that make him have to sign the accords? Has Tony been breaking the law still by ignoring the accords for Spider-Man?

Thankfully he rejects wanting to focus on the little as he lost sight of that to focused on becoming an Avenger with his hero. He goes home to find the suit in a bag on his bed, Tony still somewhat bribing Peter. And did he break into his home to put it there?

Between the events of Homecoming and Infinity War I honestly don't think Peter and Tony hung out as much as people think, only really check ups and special occasions like the photo of them in Endgame.

Now Far From Home. Peter is very reliant on Stark tech and doesn't seem to fully trust his abilities to use them as much. When he meets Fury he's given a pair of glasses that belonged to Tony. When he puts them on later he learns how powerful they were when scanning people's phones and accidentally sending a drone strike on a classmate. WHY THE HELL WOULD TONY GIVE THESE TO A TEENAGER. WHY NOT RHODEY, PEPPER, OR HELL HAPPY. These glasses are almost an exact copy of Ultron, and if they exist why didn't Tony use them during Endgame. Mysterio later gets the glasses after manipulating Peter and we see the destruction and horrors they can bring. It didn't help when everyone expected Petee to become the next Iron Man when he's been doing his own thing for a while.

That's it. That's my full opinion on the whole mentor/weird dad thing Iron Man and Spider-Man been doing. It saddens me when fans say Tony is like a father to Peter when they forget it was Ben Parker who with May took in and raised Peter, the one who's responsible for Peter being the great hero he is.",Marvel

While I was watching the movie, something grabbed my attention. Where is Infinity?

In case you didn’t realise, the Marvel Comics multiverse is the 7th generation (now 8th), and it is embodied by two figures: Eternity (the embodiment of Time) and Infinity (the embodiment of Space).

Each universe has a smaller version of these beings, and this is what we see in Thor L&amp;T.

The MCU (Universal not Multiversal) embodiment of Time; Eternity. 

But where is Infinity? She’s meant to be alongside Eternity, but at the centre of the universe (in the hall and on Eternity’s spiritual plane) she’s nowhere to be found.

Enter: Love

Love is a new character (she isn’t in the comics) so Taika must be doing something new.

She is born from Eternity (and seems to possess his powers. Not to mention she‘s a girl (just like Infinity is depicted).

But here’s the clincher: When Love is revived by Eternity we see her reflection in the water. A female version of Eternity; Infinity.

1657380600,Im_so_shiny78,Something I’ve been wanting to say.,"This is going to be harsh. 

So many people right now are not happy with the phase 4 movies because they grew up with phase 1-3. “They dont make movies like they did before.” 

Like, phase 4 movies aren’t even THAT bad. They’re decently enjoyable. It’s so annoying to hear everyone complain how marvel has lost it’s charm. Comparing current movies with Iron man and shit. The only reason you got obsessed with Iron man or any other early phase movies is because that shit was NEW to you. Seeing a superhero that can fly, has powers and saves the world with CGI near perfection, for the first time is what sold it all. 


We have  lost the characters that we grew up with. That doesn’t mean we need to turn into damn critics and compare every new movie to the “glory” of marvel’s past movies. Glory in quotes because it was only glorious because it was NEW. Y’all want marvel to sell new stuff, experiment and take risks, but also at the same time don’t fail to compare the new ones with the *old ones* and turn sour like grandpa’s. 

I agree movies CAN be good/bad. But THIS hard criticism? Like your life depends on it? For Thor L&amp;T? Ms Marvel? MOM? She hulk?

Like what about the long time readers/fans who have stuck around with Spider-Man and his story and have achieved that goal in life and want the same happiness for a character they hold dear. I just want to see Peter happy, thats all.

1657346268,ImaFireSquid,Overanalyzing the crap out of Loki and Endgame,"The spoiler tag was on, you did it to yourself. Let's go.

In Endgame, Thanos destroys the Infinity stones and is subsequently killed by Thor. Tony discovers time travel, and they go to a separate timeline to get their infinity stones and snap everyone back, which causes that universe's Thanos to switch timelines and go to the universe we know about and die along with his whole army.

In the process of this action, alternate dimension Loki escapes and his timeline is pruned by the TVA, leaving that Loki alive.

HOWEVER

That timeline impacted the ""prime timeline"". It gave the Avengers the infinity stones and gave Tony emotional closure on his daddy issues. At one point the TVA was entertaining two timelines in order to get the prime timeline on the correct path. This has weird implications though.

In the Marvel Universe, deleting one timeline doesn't undo the memories that a timeline switcher might have. Tony having that nice moment with his dad still exists, but his dad was pruned. This also means that Thanos, had he waited any longer, would have been pruned as well.

So here are some crazy implications.

Dr. Strange's ""1 timeline where we win"" is true. They might defeat Thanos any number of ways, but there's one timeline where they don't get pruned.

All the characters from timeline 2 died and were recreated after the events of Loki. Steve may have returned the Infinity Stones to a Tilda Swinton, but not the Tilda Swinton that Hulk got them from. Tony's dad was pruned, but an identical Howard Stark exists in the space where Tony's second dad used to exist.

We can place the beginning of Loki in 2012, but the end of season 1 has to be before 2023 (the year in which Endgame takes place). While the TVA exists in the distant future or an alternate dimension or something, the actual timeline split that occurs at the end of season 1 has to begin prior to 2023.

This also implies that the timeline that Steve goes back to has lost its infinity stones for another reason, possibly to another group of Avengers in another timeline. This means that there's a Thanos surplus. The Tilda Swinton donated their Thanos for Endgame, then imploded, resulting in a new timeline that also donated their Thanos. The TVA made a bonus Thanos for some other timeline to fight in some random way. It could be the Multiverse of Madness Thanos, but it's definitely a violent Thanos for some other dimension to deal with. 

This doesn't matter that much, but I wanted to make sense of some stuff in my head so I wrote it out.",Marvel

1657298217,Orcasareglorious,Gorr felt wasted on Thor 4,"*spoilers*

I know a bunch of people have already complained about Thor Love And Thunders use of Gorr, but I’ll post this anyway.

The most infuriating thing about this movie, was that Gorr was actually set up well. His backstory was changed to what in my opinion, was a far superior version, however the rest of the movie completely disregarded this, and made him a shallow and generally botched character ( until the end ).

This character just felt wasted on a horribly excecuted rom-com, especially after characters with far less potential were excecuted *so well* in the past.

LAT seemed to randomly alter Gorrs personality, from discount voldemort, to how he should have been excecuted, depending on specific scenes, making his personality seem painfully botched.",Marvel

There was a lot of criticism regarding Multiverse of madness (MOM) but that movie at least tried to deliver something whereas this one is slogging in all aspects. MOM did have a few major drawbacks but overall it's a visual treat and on first viewing, it feels quite well made (except for the ending and parts of second-half maybe). Only on critically analysing do we really understand the wrong aspects of the movie. 

Thor on the other hand is a 'certified disaster'.

Jane Foster(though she delivers an above-average performance) who was absent from the MCU for the last 9 years (not counting the 10s scene in Endgame) is suddenly brought back to the franchise which I felt is quite needless. Jane (unlike Pepper and Peggy) never felt quite at ease with Thor in the first two installments and that was the reason she was axed from Ragnarok(and just look how it turned out). Instead of bringing her back, MCU could have done well to focus on fan-favorite Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) who is reduced to a mere prop in this movie. The only good thing in this movie is Gorr who gets just 5-6 scenes to prove his prowess (thankfully Christane Bale nails that even in the limited time).

Overall his movie may be like the ""Batman and Robin"" of MCU (that may be an overstatement) but seeing your favorite hero being reduced to such a mess really gives you a shitty feeling.",Marvel

1657294166,thekingofallmen,An Honest Review of Love &amp; Thunder [SPOILERS!!],"**TOO MUCH COMEDY IN THE MOVIE**

Thor: Love and Thunder — just like Ragnarok — I found to be full of bad comedy that not even a 12 year old would laugh at. There was perhaps 2 or 3 decent jokes in there. The comedy expertise of Taika Waititi is doing the Thor character more damage than good by turning him back into the moron he was at the beginning of Thor 1. 

In Thor 1, there was an interesting and serious arc where Thor went from a proud and idiotic prince to a much more sensible and caring hero. Recent movies have turned Thor into, at best, a moron and, at worst, a joke. 

**VISUALS**

Thor 1, in my opinion, also had better presentation than Ragnarok. The visuals of Asgard in the opening of Thor 1 were brilliant and truly portrayed Asgard as a realm of gods and heroes, while Ragnarok simply lacks the awe-inspiring, golden glory of Asgard and makes it seem more like just another cool planet. Recent movies have not done Thor any favors. It was clear that Kenneth Branagh had a much more vivid picture of Asgard and he was able to very beautifully translate that picture into film. 

Love and Thunder was pretty similar to Ragnarok in this way. A few Thor 1-like visuals of Omnipotent City would have been quite alluring, although the few that we did see were pretty beautiful. The visuals of New Asgard were perfect also, creating a perfectly appropriate Earth-Asgard mix. 

The visual of Valhalla in the post credit scene was utterly beautiful and didn’t have the flashiness of Asgard, presenting it as the perfect resting place for gods. This humble yet glorious image of Valhalla made it an immediately recognisable heavenly realm that the viewer felt at ease in. 

**PORTRAYAL OF THE GREEK GODS**

Zeus was not presented too great or too poorly. His behaviour was very much in line with the Zeus of mythology and I was very pleased with his showy and selfish attitude, drawing a clear difference between the Greek and Norse gods. The accent was quite bad, making him sound strangely Italian-ish rather than Greek. I think there was an attempt to give him a greek accent but they should’ve taken the Asgardian route and given him a British or American accent instead, as it would’ve sounded less broken and more realistic.

I loved the glimpse of Dionysus, whose costume made it immediately obvious who he was. The women around Zeus also helped to show off Zeus’ personality and, despite not having speaking roles, they had an important part to play in Zeus’ scenes.

**GORR’s PORTRAYAL**

One great point of the movie was Gorr’s portrayal. Christian Bale presented the character very well and Gorr’s humour was most powerful as he was so dark and terrifying, especially in the scene where he killed the snake. His more emotional moments with his daughter felt so real and made me actually like him, although I’m not a fan of what the movie did with Love at the end. Many props to Christian Bale and India Rose Hemsworth, who played Love — yes, she is Chris Hemsworth’s daughter in real life — for their acting in this movie.

**THE USE OF JANE**

While the post credit scene set up Jane’s eventual return as a valkyrie, I think the Mighty Thor was an interesting character as her weakness in her mortal form gave her a perfect reason to keep wielding Mjolnir. I would have preferred to keep the character for a few movies before killing her off, as her arc in this movie felt too rushed towards her death.

But, her death gave us that amazing visual of Heimdall and Valhalla so I really can’t complain.

**CONCLUSION**

A lot of the acting in this movie was magnificent and the movie had a few beautiful visuals that managed to make up for some of the more lackluster visuals we were given in Ragnarok. Bale especially stood out and it is a shame we won’t get to see more of him in the MCU. I loved him in the Dark Knight trilogy and it is good to see that, ten years later, Bale still has what it takes to make a superhero movie amazing! 

In my opinion, Taika Waititi specialises in comedies and his intentionally funny movies are absolutely amazing. But the Thor character was not supposed to be funny. Therefore, I feel that he was the wrong choice for this movie franchise and that Marvel either needs to tone down the comedy or bring back Kenneth Branagh. 

The excessive attempts at comedy continued from Ragnarok and did make the movie a bit less enjoyable, breaking up the flow of seriousness with things like the screaming goats and the “I want to feel shitty about you” line, the latter being said as if he was a kid trying to confess to his first crush, even though he already knows Jane extremely well. 

But overall, a pretty good movie. I don’t think it stands on a par with Multiverse of Madness but it is one of the best movies I have seen (by general standards) and therefore was quite enjoyable. There are a few improvements I hope to see in Thor’s next movie but nothing too major.",Marvel

Should I have them watch this one movie in timeline order and skip the post credits or just let them watch it after Loki and let it be, more or less, meaningless character development?",Marvel

I loved how Thor went on with Zeus and the Thor/Jane moments were awesome. I had no idea about India Rose Hemsworth’s cameo but that was also incredibly cool and sweet. 

I did however feel the movie was maybe a bit short? Like maybe another 10 minutes of scenes with a bit more character development could have taken to another level. The movie was laugh out loud funny at times, the theater I was in cracked up multiple times, but it felt like every other second there was a joke especially in the first half of the movie, I wouldn’t want to see the jokes cut or anything but 10 minutes total of spacing in the movie could have let the jokes breath a bit better while helping emotionally develop Thor Jane and Valkyrie. 

No real big complaints otherwise! Bale was awesome as Gorr, I know he wasn’t as terrifying and evil as comics Gorr but I think it was a great portrayal.

He made Eddie his own and did very well with Venom himself. Venom is really a badass character in this movie and definitely the next one, thankfully he was a lot more realized in the sequel, given a lot more screen time and more to do. 

With this movie and Let There Be Carnage (they really should have called it Rise of Carnage or something, that title is so wordy), Venom is a lot closer to past versions of him I've seen in past stuff like games and the 90s cartoon, hell if anything, he's closest to the version of Venom in the PS1 Spider-Man game and it works very well. He's got this over the top personality, has fun in the things he does, says ""we"", his goofy a lot and is intimidating when he wants to be

As for complaints about this movie, the writing definitely needed a lot better writing, a lot of things did not make sense, Riot going across the world for as long as he did inside of this very elderly woman on foot the whole time, when before her he was inside this very fresh young woman? Also the dialogue....wow. The majority of it was absolutely terrible and it was delivered so.....idek how to describe it. 

I mean most of the dialogue between Eddie and Venom was passable to good, but other than that...yikes

And the fight between Venom and Riot was really fucking bad. Shit lighting and overall visuals, sludge-like fighting between to dark colored CGI symbiotes. 

This movie is very messy, but decent for what it is. Hardy definitely makes it watchable and Venom is very nice to watch, and that SWAT scene was easily one of the best parts

In my possibly very unpopular opinion, Let There Be Carnage does vastly improve on the many problems I have with this movie. And holy shit was that big fight near the end badass compared to Venom vs Riot",Marvel

Sure, people praise his mid 80s ASM run with Ron Frenz or Spider-Girl but not much on his editorial regime. Did people hate or like his time as EIC, I wonder? For me, his time as EIC when when my favorite of Spider-man which was late 80s/early 90s Newlywed era with classics like Kraven's Last Hunt, Venom, the 1st half of the Micheline ASM run with Todd Macfarlane &amp; Erik Larsen, and the Dematteis/Buscema Spectacular Spider-man run.",Marvel
1657150140,CappelladiIvanGrieco,Judgment Day: Eternals v Avengers v X-Men... v Inhumans?,"I have a theory: Marvel Wants to reintroduce the Inhumans in the MCU, so in the comics.

Marvel has put a spotlight on Black Bolt in MoM, putting him alongside Mr. Fantastic, Xavier, Captain Marvel and Captain Carter, all characters that have (Cap. Marvel and Carter) or will have (Mr. Fantastic, Xavier) relevance in films, series or comic book runs. Moreover, celestials are introduced seriously in ""The Eternals"" film, so just remember that Inhumans origins are connected to celestials giving Krees the opportunity to create the Inhuman Race.

What if this was just the right occasion to put a bigger comic-spotlight on them, giving people the opportunity to restart reading them, preparing the public for the new series/film about them?  
Similar stuff happened with other heroes, like Black Panther in 2016 (while Cap. America: Civil war was releasing, film featuring the Black Panther for the first time in the MCU). 

Then we have lore-based reasons: Both X-Men (X-Men vs inhumans) and Eternals (thanks to celestials) are connected with the Inhumans, and avengers are playing the part of ""the neutral team"" since the beginning of the event, meaning that there wouldn't be suspence on ""the common villain"" (if they avengers were it) that usually this kind of event features. 

And obv it would be too cool to see the Inhumans back in action, knowing how much potential they have (read Black Bolt 2017), and most of the times (in my opinion) was wasted.

1657105657,wolvera420,I have an interesting theory about Loki in the MCU and his series I noticed Loki never used his actual powers,"So my theory is that since the timeline during the MCU was riddled with getting his butt kicked, the reason why they might have picked that timeline to be sacred was, to thwart Loki from his glorious purpose and never let him meet his full potential.


 he never uses his green spell magic he uses to attack like in Loki, and if he can put a building back together before it falls on him crushing him and put it back standing up he could have taken the hulk, with his mind.

 so why didn't he... and that would be a possibility in the multiversal roulette of choices that could have happened, so why didn't they let him use that power on someone to quite literally move them without doing anything, or even knowing he has the ability learn to see memories and create an illusion with it, I know that was Sylvie's power but if she can do it, it's at least possible that they both can he just hasn't tried, or why didn't he cause gaps in attention you'd think he'd have been more sneaky than he was in the mcu movies. 


Aside from that, the Loki he picked to suffer for so long before finding out there was more, he didn't even let him sit in while Sylvie killed him. instead he picked one where he got thrown into the tva, and I think he was lying about the amount of the timeline he'd seen. it seems only certain that since he only knew up to that point he knew he was going to die because, he hasn't seen passed it and you know he's not being straight up with them. so he picked the variant of himself that thwarted his nemesis the most, so he picked one that Sylvie got mad at Loki so he'd have even less of a chance of being allowed by Sylvie to bare witness, further defeating him before he loosed the timelines letting out infinite amounts of imprisoned variants of himself to start a war with the duo coming to the screen. tho I think she'd do well teaching him sneaky tactics, she's got more stealth on him than a stealth bomber against a square metal wheel on a monster truck with enough power to burn out with it.



Tho I will say that this is just where my mind goes with this I don't actually know for sure, it's just a theory I have that I hope happens, I'd love to see a dialog of the watcher happen after they show up monologuing it maybe even slipping in a fourth wall joke on the side would be awesome. 


 but still it'd be really interesting to see if Loki and Sylvie turn out to be powerful all after this if she entere the MCU as a full time character and the whole mcu turns on it's head now that Loki and Sylvie are a formidable team, and the only reason the watcher chose them as his protagonists is because they were the ones always fighting him. boom Loki becomes the new main antagonist that shield is battling with all of his variants during a multiversal war, Loki vs the avengers and the watcher variant army. but the avengers won't actually know who they are fighting along side until it's too late",Marvel

1657094261,Envision---,Doctor Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness; Kamar-Taj scene,"# 

Wanda vs Kamar-Taj was honestly the weakest part of the entire film. If I'm actually being honest, probably one the worst action scenes in the MCU.

The whole fight was just Wanda in the air firing her basic psionic blasts &amp; telekinesis. The other sorcerers just used magical canons &amp; arrows. Like seriously? You'd think a battle between a Witch &amp; sorcerers would have a more creative battle than simple attacks. I don't even recall any spells being casted besides the shield thing.

Doctor Strange &amp; Wong literally did not do anything. They just stood there watching the sorcerers get killed while they just retreated inside doing nothing to help them.

If I was making this movie. I would've had Wanda conjure up some of those monsters that she sent after America to attack Kamar-Taj, and actually have the sorcerers actually do something meaningful While Wanda would face off against both Wong &amp; Strange. Instead of them being useless the whole time like they were.

Also, since I'm already here. Why did Strange keep America at Kamar-Taj? I know Wanda had a way of tracking her wherever she was. but Strange at least could've delayed Wanda reaching her by Opening a portal to somewhere else after they lost the battle.",Marvel

Venom himself is done pretty damn well, design, power, and personality. The only thing really missing is no connection to Spider-Man at all, but it doesn't hurt too much....

Hardy certainly makes Eddie is own and Venom too, wouldn't have chosen any other actor actually

I really wish that most of the dialogue got some more rewrites and that final fight definitely was very poorly done and was very ugly, at least Let There Be Carnage was a MASSIVE improvement on that

Nonetheless it is entertaining for what it is and Venom himself was really cool",Marvel

1657085713,Tricky_Abies_1410,Is Black Panther inseparable from his race?,"Hi, I've been reading comments on forums about race swapping and it got me thinking about BP. it seems that his race is  inseparable from his character to the point that's solely the only thing thats interesting about him. People say that you can't change his race because that would undermine his character; that you have to have black skin to be black panther, which seems kind of weird. Its like fans are saying a white person raised in born and raised in African or wakanda his entire life can't become black panther solely because his skin isn't black, that seems to run counter to the message that skin color shouldn't matter in being a hero. It also seems no one mentions the fact that white people live in African too so their could be a basis for a white black panther. I'm not trying to start an argument, i just want to sed what other people think.",Marvel

1657075127,atpaxson,Is Jane Foster Thor essential to reading Aaron’s run?,"I’m not traditionally a Marvel comics person, but I started reading Jason Aaron’s Thor when I heard that Christian Bale would be playing Gorr in Love and Thunder. Needless to say, I’ve really enjoyed Aaron’s tenure on the character thus far. I just finished Vol. 4, The Last Days of Midgard, and I see that the reading order has Thor Vol. 1: The Goddess of Thunder up next. Would skipping this material and moving straight to Unworthy Thor be detrimental to my experience as a reader? I don’t have anything against Jane Foster as a character, but I also try to be strategic with what I read since comics are such an expensive and time consuming hobby. Thanks!",Marvel
1657073366,pouyank,Animated TV shows vs. comics?,"I really want to get into the Marvel universe (not interested in MCU) and am curious how the animated shows, particularly those on disney plus (like EMH, Spiderman, X-Men) stack up against the comics? I have limited time that I want to dedicate to other nerdy pursuits like video games, anime, dc, etc. and am wondering if the shows or comics would give me a better kick. Or are the cartoons and comics different enough that they warrant a dive into both?",Marvel
1657071238,Dangerous_Morning_98,I’m getting married in September and my fiancé and I are obsessed with Marvel. I need help finding Infinity Stones!,"Little back story - when we first started dating i did NOT understand anything Marvel. I owe it to my fiancé watching Wandavision without me, me walking downstairs and getting sucked in. We spent the pandemic with him having me watch all the movies and shows and let’s just say now I am obsessed. 

So we are getting married in 74 days and I can’t wait. Of course we are tying in Marvel. Our seating arrangements will be displayed with mini Marvel lego figurines, the groomsmen are wearing Marvel socks and I would like to include “infinity stones” in my bouquets (I have 5 bridesmaids and the space stone would be on mine as something blue.) I don’t need anything super fancy but everything in like Michael’s or Amazon is suuuper cheap looking and I want it to be classier. 

Anyone have any suggestions?",Marvel
1657069106,rrahpum,Do you think the comics will ever get a definitive ending?,"At least as far as 616 is concerned, do you think it’ll end? I mean, it *must* at some point, no? I can’t imagine people will be reading about Spider-Man and MJ splitting up for the billionth time centuries from now.",Marvel
1657065729,Vertigo246,What number would you designate the MCU universe?,"Okay so as we know the MCU universe has been designated as 616 in MoM and Ms Marvel’s own Iman Vellani has said that it’s actually 19999 or something like that. Of course, Feige stated that the MCU is it’s own thing entirely and has no multiversal connection to the comics (which is dumb imo). So with that being said, what if it was? What if the MCU was apart of the same overall multiverse that is connected to the comics. What would the MCU universe be numbered? I was thinking maybe instead of a number it would be a name like infinite/infinity/lemniscate to kind of draw in the fact that there are an infinite amount of universes for those who only casually view the movies and don’t read the comics. Let me know what y’all think!",Marvel

1656996781,mradz64,My Random Question - Natasha,"This is by no means at the top of my wishlist but what do u think the chances r of another Natasha appearance in the MCU? My thought would be it’s possible because of her soul stone sacrifice, she could be anything -  an evil zombie mercenary assistant for red skull or maybe even become the new stone protector and red skull comes back to life since he ‘served his duty’. I’m not stuck in the past, I’m glad we r going heavier cosmic, but we all  know Hollywood, and that she ended on a crappy note a lot of people r still bothered about. Totally random I know.",Marvel
1656993674,CrispyGold,Ya know its rather frustrating how MCU synergy has rendered the Avengers and Guardians line-ups unchanging especially in adaptations,"Like its a noticeable thing, the Avengers and Guardians line-ups in the shows and games are always the movie group. These are groups with a fairly diverse array of characters which a main appeal that the line-up shifts overtime with changing and members. But when you look at Avengers Assemble, the Guardians cartoon, and their Square Enix games, its always the same exact characters every time aside from only new guy (Falcon in Assemble, and Kamala in the Avengers game). 

Its extremally rigid especially when you notice how Black Widow and Gamora are the only female members usually. No Scarlet Witch, no Wasp, no Moondragon, or Phyla-Vell, its always just those 2.

And of course this extends to the comics. The Guardians line-up for most of the 2010s until the Cates run was incredibly stale with the Bendis and Duggan runs allowing just the movie 5 as the only cosmic characters. The only new members was during Bendis run and it was strictly Earth characters like Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Agent Venom, Kitty Pryde, and Thing. Its like they were completely adverse to having a cosmic character that wasn't in the movie. 

Its bafflingly uncreative how restrictive they are with the line-ups.",Marvel

The shows (moon knight, she hulk, ms marvel) have all had bad cgi but I’ll give them a pass since they’re shows. The things I’ve noticed are portals in spider man and dr strange, don’t even get me started on the infamous black widow scene, and based on the scenes in Thor trailer, the cgi is at an absolute low. If you take note of the black and white scenes (among other scenes as well) it is very weird looking.

It would either be pretty cool or funny.

1656806643,JamesPlayzReviews,My Theory for MCU Secret Wars,"Now as we all know Phase 4 is coming to an end and Papa Fiege has been cooking up something (as they say in WandaVision) ""really good!"". In all seriousness he has even stated that he has been teasing for the past few movies and if we look really closely the only thing there to connect the dots is Kang the Conqueror and the Multiverse. So I have a theory that will bring some unexpected surprises.

Secret Wars Hosts in the Past:

Now in the past there have been been many hosts for the event known as Secret Wars, an event where a villain uses his abilities to merge the Multiverse together and have heroes and villains battle to the death for a piece of land. In most universes for example Earth-616 (Main Universe), Earth-9811(Secret Wars: 25 years later), Earth-90251(Doom kept Beyonder's powers), Earth-92131(X-Men and Spider-Man cartoons), and Earth-12041 the host of Secret Wars has been the Beyonder. In other universe such as Earth-616, Earth-92131, and Earth-90251 Doctor Doom has been the host of Secret Wars. In Marvel's most recent animated series for kids Battleworld(basically an animated show all about Secret Wars) aka Earth-TRN896 Thanos and Loki were the hosts of Secret Wars. However as you've seen so far as for powerful beings causing Secret Wars one of the most powerful is missing from the list that villain being Kang the Conqueror.

My Theory:

Being that we already saw a glimpse of Kang in Loki due to both his variant HeWhoRemains and his statue in the alternate TVA. Along with the fact that we are going to see him along with M.O.D.O.K in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I have a theory that Ant-Man is going to accidentally free Mr. Richards (not Reed for you idiots who aren't paying attention) from wherever he is in the Quantum realm. And in doing so Kang will start Secret Wars, while this would be a first for Kang it certainly wouldn't be much of a surprise. Like if Thanos can do it in a cartoon centered for kids then you bet your boots Kang can do it in a movie meant for teenagers and adults.

Now how would Kang go about doing this you ask? Well most of the time for example comics and TV shows Kang's plans center around time travel or as Marvel rules call it, ""Alternate universe creation"". In the Lego Marvel Universe Kang used a device that he had put on worlds he had been time/universe traveling to and merged the universes into one creating a sort of Secret Wars but it was never officially called that. But maybe Kang could do so again in the MCU this time but this time to create an official Secret Wars.

People That I Believe Would Show Up In This Secret Wars:

Okay so now we've got our story Ant-Man made another foolish mistake and set Kang who was trapped in the Quantum Realm free and he has now created Secret Wars. Now we have to figure out who other than the people of Earth-199999(comics)/Earth-616(movies) would show up. Well let's see we saw a whole bunch of alternate universe characters from Endgame like the 2012 and others, we also have all those Lokis from Loki. Or even the What If...? characters, heck everyone would love to Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield again no question. Maybe we'd finally get a live action version of the characters from Spiderverse. And with how things are going maybe characters like Venom, Morbius (""It's Morbin time""), Vulture, and others could show up and fight Spider-Man since everyone has that theory. Heck we could possibly even finally meet SSU Spider-Man in Secret Wars, though I sincerely doubt we'll see him in Secret Wars before we see him in the SSU.",Marvel

So in Multiverse of Madness, we learned that Strange caused an incursion. The question is, where? As far as we know, the Dark Dimension is a **dimension**, not a **universe**. I don't think the incursion is there. Besides, how would Strange be guilty? He could only cause an incursion in universes he's been to.

Unless the Dark Dimension is a universe. That brings me to another discussion which I don't want to open now (it's not the main point), about whether there is only one Dark Dimension (it's a universe) or infinite Dark Dimensions (it's a dimension in every universe).

In any case, where would the incursion be if not the Dark Dimension? Clea can't travel through the multiverse. I get how she would know about an incursion, but how would they fix it? Would they enlist America Chavez's help?

1656785746,SlothPunk2077,Marvel desperately needs more games and better cartoons,"With how violently the MCU catapulted Marvel into *mainstream* mainstream (Even during the early 10s) there’s not enough focus on other mediums. Marvel/Disney has a great opportunity to let other studios create.

I remember watching stuff like Earth’s Mightiest heroes when I was younger, I barely remember it now but it's how I was introduced to Marvel beyond Spider-Man. I heard recently it would’ve had a third season that would've been as big as some of the DC cartoons back in 00s, but every bit of the cartoon and gaming department was gut by Marvel to be MCU-adjacent. The only good thing I feel we got out of that was Ultimate Spider-Man and even then, plenty of issues. I only really remember watching the later seasons and got pretty good vibes from what it was trying to do, despite the flaws (Which I didn’t gaf about at the time, I loved it). Recent cartoons are terrible, and they just feel like they’re made to advertise the MCU, and have horribly animation, like they expected none of the audience to care. The only good thing we got in a while was Spider-Verse. Marvel used to have a bigger variety of these cartoons and other non-MCU content that could stand on its own legs. Not to mention the total lack of X-Men and Fantastic Four stuff during the majority of last decade on top of everything being MCU ads.

DC these days likes to make stand alone animated adaptations of comic book stories, spin offs that treat all its lore like mythology. They’ve dominated everything except live actions movies. Instead they just feel like soulless ads with no level of creativity. We had a Deadpool cartoon coming up but it got axed bc Disney didn't like it, something called Tigra and Dazzler too. I hear Hit Monkey got a cartoon but I haven't watched it yet, IMO it looks closer to the kind of thing DC would do with their heroes, if anyone's seen it please tell me so or otherwise.

As for their games, it feels like that all dried up as the MCU picked up steam. Spider-Man was a great game but it was a console exclusive, and the only good Marvel game that decade that wasn't delisted. GOTG was also pretty nice but Avengers fucked up the perception of it and they probably won't be able to spring off of that any further. Marvel Infinite was just a big MCU ad.

There's just such a terrible lack in variety in anything that isn't live action, and anything that is live action needs to be MCU-adjacent. I hope in the future cartoons improve, and we get a bigger variety of games (Which may happen) that aren't MCU advertisements.

It’s not too late either, in fact now is probably the best time for them to start doing it since the movies aren’t on the forefront of everyone’s minds.",Marvel

Basically the meme known as Bully Maguire in this is just an alternate version of the 2002 Sony universe Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) whom in this alternate universe, during the third movie's events chose to embrace the violent and aggressive nature given to him by Venom and in the future uses his genius to become a successful industrialist, but over the course of several years he finds a planet where symbiotes live peacefully but uses the tech he develops to control them with a hive mind (kind of like Tony Stark but with aliens instead of armors), and somehow in a strange twist of events he becomes an evil warlord who kills any superhero in his universe and tries to use his hive controlled symbiotes to rule the world, typical villain goals. But instead of having a cause he just does it cause he can, like the personality we saw in the meme he acts humorous, has a big ego, banters and taunts his enemies, and a characteristic is that he never masks cause his face symbolizes fear to his enemies (or something like that, Bully Maguire never masks). This is just a premise basically, his involvement in my story isn't that deep outside of one confrontation with the main characters but I actually want him to have a fight with Scarlet Witch at some point. I'd like to know what you think about this. I still think it's a ridiculous idea but in my head I think it could work with a good hand.",Marvel

1656662327,madmaxx2,Top 5 favorite characters?,"Who are you top five favorite characters and why? 

*Processing img xg3rf6m7vw891...*

1 - Wanda: Her evolution is fascinating. From starting as a secondary antagonist in AoU to her star turn as The Scarlet Witch, no one has been on such a wild journey as her. Her trauma is so severe. Although I didn't like what they did with her in MoM, she'll still be my favorite character no doubt. What Elizabeth Olsen brings to role never fails to impress. 

2 - Cap: This is a man. Played beautifully by Chris Evans, he became one of my favorites in TWS because he's such a loyal friend and genuinely good person. He quickly shot up to #2 in Civil War because I have major authority issues and Cap's choice to flip off the govt here was so satisfying. He trusts his judgement above all else and he's always correct in that. Cap is a man. The ultimate man. 

3 - Sersi: Speaking of the ultimate man, I think Sersi might be the ultimate woman. Despite only seeing her once, Sersi has instantly become one of my favorites because her femininity is her ultimate strength. Her ability to transmute her surroundings feels like an allegory for her ability to heal the world, which she essentially did. Dying to see her again. Gemma Chan delivers on all fronts - love her facial expressions. 

4 - Rocket: Love this furball. Bradley Cooper's best performance. Layered, funny, but also deeply moving. It's a CGI character and yet Cooper's performance transcends that. I'm already mourning the potential loss of him one day should Cooper decide to vacate the role. Cap was given so much story, but I don't know how I can feel satisfied with a Rocket ending. Maybe if he got his own movie. 

5: Nebula: Much like Rocket, this poor woman has been through too much. Choosing the wrong side would not have only been easier for her, but also made much more sense given where she was in life initially, and yet, she zigged when the universe might have expected her to zag. She's introverted but you can tell she craves connection and Karen Gillan just does a wonderful job.",Marvel

Then there's the part where they take the speeding taxi straight out of Ghostbusters and Betty gets angrier than Bruce. Idk, I just think more movies could use little character moments like that.

To their credit they seem to get the accents both when brown people are saying english words, and when native english speakers are saying sanskrit/urdu/hindi origin words. And even capture some of the code switching that happens between school and home.

I observed a few things about Pizza Dog. 
A. He seemed to be waiting for Kate or someone outside when she first spots him. 
B. He attacks the gangster guy in the alley right as he finds the watch. Seemingly in response to him finding it. 
C.He then disengages from the gangster and barks to Kate before leading her away when she appears a moment later. Almost as if trying to protect her. 
D. He is despite being what appears to be a stray dog not particularly starved or dirty. And his eye while gone seems to have been cared for and well healed. And he is surprisingly well behaved and responsive. 
E. Finally the dog's goal seems to be (to me) to stick close to the watch. For whatever reason. Idk why but. At the end there he is with all of them. Near the watch. 

So my question is. Does anyone know anything about the dog? 
Who it is (besides a pizza loving party animal)? Or why it would be after that watch?

I think Tom Hardy or Daniel Radcliffe would be great because they're both the right height range.

I don't mind who it is but someone good for the character and the right height. 

I'm only venting because I've been hearing a lot of rumours of him being another sexy tall man, which just isn't what Wolverine is about. He is meant to be short and ugly and that's ok. Ugly short men can be good actors they don't all need to be Chris Evans level to do well.

There are too many sexy males in MCU we need some more average looking men.

Anyway that's just how I feel. Maybe I'm biased because I'm short and average looking haha",Marvel

1656479773,SignificantChair8517,My Pitch For An Avengers Game,"No ideas for a story or campaign, mainly just how it would work and stuff.

It would be an open-world game where you can explore New York. The game would feature Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor as the main/starter characters. Eventually, more people such as Black Panther and Ant-Man would be added. You'd be able to switch between all 6 members at any time and the ones not used will occasionally attack an enemy.  Like Insomniac's Spider-Man, there would be the missions tab on the menu which would be used to play missions to play out the hero's origins. There would be an equipment system in the game and it would change the appearance. However, you'd be able to switch to a cosmetics tab that would let you choose armors you have to apply for the look only and change the color schemes of each item or the entire armor, like in Destiny 2.  Iron Man would work differently than this, where he would have the equipment system still, but his would not only buff it but they would be parts of different armors and marks that would be weaker if it's not in the full set. You'd be able to switch into different avengers by using a system like Insomniac's Spider-Man where you hold a button, time slows, and you can choose a character through a menu. It'd also feature an event system, where after the campaign, there would be events where there would be boss battles or big fights, such as a Chitauri invasion or a Black Order battle.",Marvel

1656462861,whatdidyoudo1,Is Madame Web An All-Female Spider-Verse Movie?,"I have a feeling it might be.

You have Dakota Johnson playing the titular character, Madame Web. I remember, in the animated show (1990s), she put together a team of Spider-Heroes to save the Multiverse.

Sydney Sweeney could be Ghost Spider / Spider-Gwen. Or she could be Black Cat and the Silver and Black movie has been absorbed into this.

Isabela Merced must be Anya Corazon, the monochromatic Spider-Hero.

Emma Roberts could be Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew. Or Gwen Stacy. I saw some fan art and saw that she's pretty much a dead ringer for Gwen. Or Silver Sable.

Celeste O'Connor's could be either Valerie the Librarian, a gender-swapped Miles Morales, a gender-swapped and race-bent Peter Parker (Peta? Petra?). Or a race-swapped Julia Carpenter or Mayday Parker. Honestly, she could be anyone.

If they announce an Asian actor, that must be Silk and possibly confirmation of the kind of movie they might be doing.

If it is an all-female Spider-Verse, I just hope it's good. They need to focus on telling a great and compelling story. It has the potential to be even more of a Multiverse of Madness than Multiverse of Madness! I hope it doesn't turn out like Ghostbusters or Oceans 8.

The MCU has made every single one of their heroes a household name by making them great, recognisable, individual, and compelling characters. I feel like Madame Web, if done right, can do the same.",Marvel

Favorite: I would say Spider-Man No Way Home for obvious reasons. Besides getting to see Andrew and Tobey return I really liked what they did with Tom’s Spider-Man in this movie. The journey he went on during the movie was really cool to see. Him having to end up sacrificing his relationships and all his loved ones memories of him really resonated with me and was a big deal for his character.

Least Favorite: 
I would probably say Black Widow. I just don’t like how they handled Taskmaster at all. Also the number of things Natasha was able to survive in this movie made no sense lol. And since we knew her character couldn’t die in this movie it made the stakes feel really low. There we’re some bright spots with Florence Pugh as Yelena.

There is Thanos obviously, Green Goblin, Kilgrave, Fisk, Jigsaw, Scarlet Witch of course, Ego.. I guess there are more standout villains than I thought, but that still isn't very many given how much MCU content there is

brittish actors

set in space and barely no mention of nordic countries just sometimes

english pronounciation of all words

then we have egyptian like moonknight

arabic music everywhere even credits

middle eastern main actor middle eastern voice actor

if marvel did the same to thor or tor as we call him in sweden we'd have more mystery and a nordic main actor and nordic music, i feel they stayed a lot more faithful to egyptian mythology than they ever did to nordic, if they did the same to egyptian wouldn't it be called cultural appropriation?

i feel thor needs a reboot especially now that chris evans has decided not to play him, i would love a show about him made with the same care as with moonknight that stayed true to the mythology, thor has always been such a sidecharacter in the marvel universe and a leftover of the past marvel and so has asgard it feels very prehulk reboot.",Marvel

1656295455,lazurusknight,My only issue with MOM was how they portrayed Dr. Reeds (Spoilers),"  For those of you that have seen the new Dr Strange movie-

  I've loved all the Dr Strange movies, but there is one part of this 3rd one that is still sticking in my craw:

  Dr Reed Richards, introduced as the worlds smartest man, goes up against the Scarlet Witch, and has no other plans or devices to deal with her other than ""stretchy-arm punch!""  No tech, no toys, no discernible rational strategy...

  Seems a massive disservice to both the character and John K, while also appears like lazy writing.

1656245261,db191996,What's the Reason Why Mjöllnir chose Jane ?," 

The reason why Mjöllnir choose Jane as the new Thor in the comics , is that Thor became unworthy, but in the MCU Thor is still worthy and I doubt that the comics unworthy Thor storyline is going to happen in LOVE and Thunder.

After failing in Infinity War , Thor felt unworthy , let himself go, and became a little weird , And he gone on a crazy adventure to find peace.

During the time high Thor got a pep talk from his mom, allowing him to achieve his redemption arc, and him being able to summon Mjöllnir made him feel worthy again.

Which was a type of validation. It was a sign of his failures are forgiven and now he can forge a new path for himself and remember that Ragnarok was about the understanding that he's not defined by his hammer .

**But Who's Jane From Thor Love And Thunder ?**

Remember , Jane is a very smart woman. She's a leading astrophysicist and astronomer, and she's an expert on all things related to Asgard.

She is the first human mortal who probably ever set foot on the ground of Asgard. All of those things are the reason why [she received a Nobel Prize](https://www.hotseatmag.com/article/how-jane-fixes-the-hammer-and-becomes-worthy-in-thor-love-and-thunder).

Jane worked on the shield for a while, so she probably picked up some tech that will come in handy when fixing a broken cosmic Hammer .[Read More](https://www.hotseatmag.com/article/how-jane-fixes-the-hammer-and-becomes-worthy-in-thor-love-and-thunder)",Marvel
1656242690,Homo-alono,James Gunn didn’t do the GOTG justice,"I’m gonna preface this by saying I actually like most of Jame’s work. Suicide squad, peacemaker (although I think that show had some major flaws), and I actually think the guardians movies pretty decent as a fun turn off your brain watch. That being said I have some major issues with the way james characterizes the guardians.

Right off the bat let’s all agree that Drax and groot aren’t even really characters. They are both textbook definition of one-note and every chance at them getting any amount of development seemed to be traded for a cheep laugh. Everyone will remember “I am groot” and the “Why is gamora” and “invisible Drax” jokes, but no one actually cares about the characters they came from because there’s nothing to care about.

Rocket raccoon I thought was well done actually. No notes

Gamora is cool when she isn’t just being peters girlfriend. James Gunn seems to really like the “Idiot boy meets badass girl” trope (which I’m not a fan of) and gamora seems to be thoroughly stuck in the badass girl dating idiot boy role. I think her arc with nebula was good and I wish we got more of that. Her being killed off while implying Thanos did truly love her then bringing back a 2014 version was some of the most wtf writing I’ve ever seen but go off I guess.

Mantis hasn’t had a whole lot of screen time but I feel like she’s going in the same direction as Drax and groot, where Pom’s performance is so bubbly and cute that she just gets used for audience pleasing jokes instead of real character growth. Thor 4 screenshots have shown that she’ll be doing something with Thor so hopefully it’s more serious 

Nebula was cool. No notes

Yondu was cool. Although not sure why they made it seem like he was actually a good father figure in the end while spending 2 movies telling us he wasn’t but go off.

And finally Peter Quill. Despite being the the main guardian and the protagonist of both guardians movies, Star lord falls into the same trap as Drax and groot. Half the time Peter could be developing as a character, he’s instead being made the butt of a joke. That joke being that he’s stupid, hence “idiot boy meets badass girl” trope. As much as I love pre-2014 comic starlord, I’m not mad that his outfit, weaponry, and personality were changed. I’m just mad they made him stupid and a joke. The best part about pre-2014 comic Peter was that he was an intelligent leader who had the respect of people way stronger than him. Fine, make him a goofy space pirate, but I hate that he’s an idiot who no one respects despite being the “leader” of the guardians. For the first movie? Fine, but that should’ve changed after or even during the second movie.

So yeah, I guess my main issue with these characters is how often making a joke trumps character development. But these are just my opinions, I’d like to hear opinions on these characters.",Marvel
1656240408,Harrisontb,Who is Earth 616's #1 hero?,"One thing I've noticed is that in the MCU, Iron Man is essentially seen as the world's #1 hero, probably due to RDJ's great portrayal and the popularity of the character skyrocketing. What I'm curious about is, since I can't find anything saying that it's the same in comics, who would be considered the Marvel Earth's #1 hero? 

I've heard Spider-Man is considered to be the #1 by other heroes, but most people consider him New Yorks hero first and foremost, and that while he has been in big situations that affect the whole world, he wouldn't be considered #1 in that aspect.

I feel that I should clarify, this is about the consensus among the general population of the marvel world. I'm not asking who is the strongest or who the real #1 actually is or who should be (though I'm curious to hear what you have on those subjects so feel free to mention them, it's just not the focus), but about who the citizens hope for when there's danger.

It would be pretty much identical to the comic version except for the fact that Jen resents Bruce for turning her into a monster. However, after the Leader lays a trap for the Hulk that makes Shulkie go on a rampage, Hulk calms her down and Jen apologizes to Bruce for acting so horribly. Hulk offers to take the blame for all the destruction and She-Hulk immediately rejects the idea. Then, the army and Iron Man show up and want to detain the Hulk. They tell She-Hulk to stand aside, but she refuses. She stomps the ground hard, causing a small earthquake and then Hulk uses a thunderclap to send Iron Man and the army flying. Hulk and She-Hulk escape and turn back into Bruce and Jen. Bruce asks why Jen did that and Jen says because they're family and she's not going to abandon family. Bruce brings up her law career and Jen says she doesn't care about that anymore and says that he's more important than some dumb law career. Bruce starts to protest again and Jen envelops him in a tight hug. She firmly says that she isn't going anywhere and that she owes him her life. Bruce smiles for the first time (he hadn't smiled once up until this point) and says ""Alright, Jen, if that's what you want."" Jen smiles, too, and starts walking into the sunset while saying, ""Come on, we've got a long road ahead of us"" with Bruce following close behind her.

The entire show would be the adventures of Hulk and She-Hulk on the run. Bruce would be voiced by Neal McDonough, Hulk would be voiced by Fred Tasticore, and Jen/She-Hulk would be voiced by Maria Canals-Barrera. Guest stars would include Josh Keaton as Spider-Man, Brian Bloom as Captain America, Rick D. Wasserman as Thor, and Benny Grant as Rick Jones.

1656203966,Honest_Bank8890,I changed my mind,"So rewatching Multiverse of Madness, Ive changed my mind, originally watching this movie I gave it a 7.2/10 as I felt that it regressed Wanda's character and that's the resolution seemed to just wrap up everything as it seemed everything that's happened in the movie didn't matter.

But rewatching for a second time I feel that now Wanda vision has escaped my head a little bit I can see how truly frightening wanda is and I could feel her grief through her performance but still I feel that I could only feel this from her because I have forgotten the journey she took in Wanda Vision, but still good movie

Third Strange is an absolute dick in every single universe,  and he really should be a better person. But still America Chavez could have disappeared half way into the movie and I wouldn't have noticed, which isn't good when you are trying to build up a potential young avengers team. 

The horror elements were very good I always believed that but I felt they could have just run wild with Wanda, she could if she wanted to destroy universes so why not use it

How does anyone know that isn't just what a Sokovian person sounds like in English?  How do you judge the quality of a fake accent when the accent itself isn't real?

At first I thought it was only gone because they were in an American sitcom on the show, but then the show moved beyond the sitcom stuff and it just never came back.  No explanation, nothing.  If they wanted to get rid of it, they could've at least phased it out gradually, like she was improving her English over time or something, but instead they just gave it the axe without really addressing it.

1656072675,DasEmperor,Disney Plus shows (besides What If) judged based on how likely it would be for another MCU character to show up.,"I mean, some of these are pretty tight, all things considered, but others are less well put together.

**Wandavision**

Likelihood- Very low.

Most likely to get involved- Falcon, War Machine, Dr. Strange, Wang.

&gt;!This is a massive crisis, but it's a massive crisis in podunk nowhere quickly taken over by Sword. The only characters that would even know about it are characters that had high level military clearance and characters who could innately sense that stuff happening. If Dr. Strange didn't smell it, Falcon and War Machine don't exactly have a record of getting involved in sketchy government groups, so they're probably not the top of the ""trust"" list. I put Wang on there because Dr. Strange is unknown, Wang is public information if you know where to look.!&lt;

**Falcon and the Winter Soldier**

Likelihood- Somewhat low

Most likely to get involved- Hulk.

&gt;!In this case, the issue wasn't a major catastrophic threat, just a small group of people with the super soldier serum. The only character that should be really concerned is the guy who got a bad dose of it and turned into a monster. This isn't public information though, so it's unlikely that this is going to have a major impact.!&lt;

**Loki**

Likelihood- Very low.

Most likely to get involved- The Eternals.

&gt;!The Eternals go as far back as human society, so there's no point in time for the TVA to go that the Eternals haven't been, and if you convince them that you're a threat once, they're going to be there 1000 years later, in the exact same physical condition, ready to throw down. They're also quite a bit tougher than Loki, so they're not easy to prune.!&lt;

**Hawkeye**

Likelihood- Incredibly high.

Most likely to get involved- Spider Man.

&gt;!Peter Parker lives two blocks from Rockefeller Center, where the finale of Hawkeye takes place, and it's not quiet. There are guns firing, the tree falls down (a tree that's standing up in the final moments of No Way Home) and Kingpin gets involved, and in the comics, Kingpin and Spiderman fight all the time.!&lt;

**Moon Knight**

Likelihood- Fairy high.

Most likely to get involved- Dr. Strange and Wang.

&gt;!The finale of Moon Knight takes place in Cairo, which is a huge city. This wouldn't be a quiet event, it's just shot from an angle that makes it seem like Cairo is just an empty desert. Dr. Strange and Wang conveniently both have the ability to teleport and the knowledge to say ""oh wow that's a bad magical thing, let me help fight the giant alligator.""!&lt;

**Ms. Marvel**

Likelihood- Incredibly high.

Most likely to get involved- Half of the MCU, but especially Dr. Strange, Wang, and Shang-Chi.

&gt;!Most of the MCU characters live around the vicinity of New York, since that's where Marvel's offices were when most of those characters were created. Jersey City is 21 minutes away by car, 37 minutes by foot. If I'm Dr. Strange and I see a video of a girl on youtube shooting magic in a public convention, I'm going there to see what the heck is going on.!&lt;",Marvel

1656013207,alexis_ramest,I find it very difficult to get into comics,"Okay so I have two major issues:


1. I really like somewhat old stories. If you've ever played Ultimate Alliance that is the ""era"" of comic book stories. However, I cannot stand the writing of those old comic books, where there was a yellow background panel with the main character doing a flip and about three essays worth of text where said character is thinking about their own powers. Not that I dislike reading but I think modern comics do it right with their combination of visuals and dialogue. Is there a modern version retelling of old stories and arcs?


2. I can't for the life of me find what I'm supposed to be reading after an issue and dislike that a lot of things are happening that I don't know about. Say I'm reading The Amazing Spider-Man number 45 or whatever. Well, when you get to 46 characters talk about events that happened in Amazing Spider-Man even more Amazing that I didn't know about and now I have to look for it. It's even worse when they do it as a series but split into two comics and for this one I have a real example with real issue numbers. If you read Amazing Spider-Man #440 it ends saying you now have to read Peter Parker: Spider-Man #96 which btw I also haven't found in Marvel Unlimited because the one of the time period is named differently and doesn't align with what I'm reading in issue #96 and the one with the correct name is from another time period completely. The story then continues in #441 and then in #97 which I also haven't found. How are you supposed to keep up with this? Why not make it a single issue? Why are there 2000 different issues of Spider-Man all with just 1 number? How can I know when to read them chronologically?


Anyway, thanks for reading my rant and hopefully someone can help me find someway to organize my reading. Surely there are chronological lists and modern retellings but I haven't found them. If it helps, what I'm mostly looking for is Spider-Man, Daredevil and X-Men.",Marvel

1656009132,DasEmperor,I think Ms Marvel went a little hard on the Islam,"I mean, I like the show a lot and will continue to like it. I’d call it the most visually stunning Disney+ marvel show and it’s not close. The villains look comparatively bland but whatever.

I think we’ve now reached the point of trying too hard to talk about Islam though. We had a speech about Muslim headwear, a wedding, a discussion about different social groups, and all the while I didn’t really question it because I’m American and Islam is a minority religion… but then I imagined what it would be like if it was Christian.

They talk about the seating and construction of the church as the preacher gives a lesson, then the very wise preacher offers sage advice to the protagonist. She goes out and does one super thing and the feds immediately know that she’s Christian. The non Christian friend reads the Torah for clues on her superpower, and then they go to a wedding in a church where they say a prayer and do communion afterwards. The heroine even overhears the preacher giving perfect advice to others that happens to apply perfectly to her.

I’m not upset by the amount of time dedicated to Islam or anything since it is a long running show, but I don’t think it’s specifically necessary to go into such detail about character’s religious beliefs in a franchise where we’ve already confirmed two objectively correct religions- the norse and Egyptian pantheons. I watch scenes about Islam and wonder why nobody told them about that time the skeleton bird god and crocodile goddess had a fistfight in Cairo. I don’t think it’s meant to be tragic, but it feels as tragic as when captain America said there was only one God back in 2012.",Marvel

1656008498,VeganArmieHammer,So the MCU has been doing a pretty bad job with the Young Avengers so far,"Let's take Kate Bishop.

In the MCU, they turned Kate into an annoying fangirl (Renner's own words, btw), a simpering wannabe sidekick and a total klutz for mostly (unfunny) comedic effect. 

Then there's America Chavez. In the comics she's a no-nonsense powerhouse, think Diaz from B99 meets Supergirl. In the movie, they made her a personality-less damsel in distress that spends the entire film running from a fight and cowering behind Doctor Strange like a scared little girl.

I know that obviously Ammit is portrayed as the villain here so it seems to be ""correct"" to agree with Khonsu bu not neccesarily. Thanos is the villian in the infinity saga but there's discussion online about if what he did was the right thing as well, coz after all I've also heard of some fans saying that the best villians are those who actually believe that they are doing the right thing, especially so for Arthur Harrow.  


Khonsu: ""I only punish those who have chosen evil, I am real justice!""  
He waits for a crime to be committed before punishing them.  


But on the other hand if Ammit was allowed to rule, millions wouldn't have suffered from Hitler's war and genocide and like Harrow said, by the time Khonsu delivers their retribution, people have already suffered, but with Ammit there would be no war, no crime, the world would become an ideal world and I think everyone would be kind hearted? so that way it would seem to make Earth a paradise, not a bad option either.  


As of now I'm in a dilemma myself but I guess I'm leaning toward Khonsu/mainstream opinion because it gives people a chance to change and they might not commit a crime / evil deed after all.

Ok,

Just watched the new doctor strange since it came out on Disney plus today. It had some fun scenes and some really badass ones too. However, the introduction of the Illuminati just for them to die five minutes later was so ridiculous… why even introduce them in the first place? Not to mention, they said the scarlet witch was barely a concern to them, then they proceed to get absolutely solo’d by her. They stood zero chance. I was just watching in disbelief that the movie was written this way. Before I saw it, I knew about how the Illuminati was involved and I was so excited to see them guide strange through the multiverse in an adventure to get home. But it was just them talking trash to strange and then dying. Dumb. 

Black bolt died by yelling because he had no mouth. How? His body can’t handle the sound waves he creates? How does he make them in the first place? They need to travel through his body in order to come out of his mouth. But somehow his head and body can’t handle it. Xavier dies in the most anticlimactic way, with all his psychic powers he can’t do anything to the scarlet witch. Captain marvel gets crushed by a measly stone statue, but Brie Larson captain marvel can fly through thanos’s ship without issue?

Yeah, the second half of this movie was totally Sam Raimi and it was dope af. Liz Olsen nearly steals the show, she was absolutely fucking good af and is easily the best she was in the whole MCU. Strange, he was..I'd say as good as he always has been. Liz actually did surpass him, but that's not a knock on Benedict by any means, he was the second best as far as leads go.

I feel like this movie could have been a little bit better, like if the first half was just as good as the second half as far as the tone goes, but it was still pretty damn solid overall

I also found it pretty cool to see Stewart as Charles and John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic! Now I do not know if Charles will return in the future, given Wanda broke his neck and a small guess is that was just a throwaway fan service moment, but Krasinski for sure will reprise Mr. Fantastic, given a F4 reboot is on the way. He was pretty cool for the little bit of time he had in this movie and was so Stewart.

I'd very much like to see Raimi continuing his directing in Marvel Studios",Marvel

What if Sony and Fox made a deal with Marvel in 2006-2007 and what are your thoughts?",Marvel
1655928629,bustingshirts,"What's up with Sony taking the ""Anti-Hero"" approach with their movies centered around villains?","Because I don't understand why they can't just make these characters that've always been villains in the comics villains in the movies. First Venom, then Morbius, and now Kraven?

All three of these guys are utter killers who wreak havoc all the time in the comics. So, it's uncanny to see them be nothing like that in the movies.",Marvel

1655911930,peekitty,"Sony's ""Sinister Six"" franchise -- what'll it take to create the new ""anti-hero Avengers""?","For gue$$able reason$, Sony is trying to set up their Sinister Six as ""anti-hero Avengers"". While their first two members were ready as-is, Kraven will reportedly be an ""animal lover"" now to fit a more heroic mold. What other tweaks do you think Sony will make?

The roster will apparently be:

**Venom:** They leaned hard into the ""Lethal Protector"" thing in Venom 2, and made the symbiote super likeable. Done.

**Morbius:** In the comics, Morbius ranges from anti-hero to hero already. The film mismanaged this, making him into more of a hypocrite and killer, but they clearly ***thought*** they were creating an anti-hero. So he theoretically fits the role already, but in practice will need a lot of fixing.

(*Related Tangent:* The film flopped hard, and its star has been accused of raping minors. Do you think Sony will proceed as planned, replace Leto, or quietly drop Morbius from the line-up?)

**Vulture:** ""I'm not sure how I got here. Has to do with Spider-Man I think. I'm still figuring this place out, but I think a bunch of guys like us should team up. Could do some good."" Intriguing. But how will Sony turn Toomes into an anti-hero? He's only ever acted in his own self-interest and to protect his family. He kept Peter's secret, but it seemed (to me) that it was because he ""owed him one"" for saving Liz and himself. Was the allure of Morbius strong enough to Morb right over Vulture's selfishness?

**Kraven:** Actor ATJ recently said that Kraven will be more of an ""animal lover"" in this film, which is surprising as Kraven was always the epitomy of the safari hunter, slaughtering rare and endangered creatures. Will this rebranding work? At least Kraven has always had an ironclad code of honor, so that helps him seem quasi-heroic I guess.

**Madame Web:** We don't know much. Will Dakota Johnson play Cassandra or Julia? Will she be just a clairvoyant or explicitly connected to the Web of Life? Fitting her into an anti-hero team will be easy; the real challenge may be giving her an exciting film.

**El Muerto:** A super-powered luchador played by rapper Bad Bunny. I mean, this is either gonna be hilariously enjoyable or absolute garbage, right? There's no in-between. Past that, I've gotta be honest, I know *nothing* about this character. Does the anti-hero thing fit?

So, as far as we know, that's the Sinister Six. Not exactly a classic line-up, but did Sony pick the right characters for their ""not the Avengers"" super-team franchise?",Marvel

It makes it seem much more mysterious, and almost eldritch, at times the nexus seemed to almost have a kind of it’s own, and as it macabre protector stands the shambling husk known as the man-thing

I realize man-thing isn’t a super important character, but I personally thought the fact he mostly appears in cameos extremely randomly adds to the appeal, much like the nexus itself it made him more mysterious, being some anomalous force even master magicians like dr strange or super scientists like hank pym can’t fully explain or understand",Marvel

1655769214,AcademicAssistant88,"After seeing Doctor Strange 2 (MoM), do you believe marvel will ever give us a 616 (MCU version, apparently) Illuminati?","It was great seeing the Illuminati in MoM, especially Reed and Xavier, but the whole takeaway of that film (from my reading) being that our 616 Strange is the sort of Ultimate version, the Strangest Strange, if you will, seemed to imply that he would never stoop to such ethically dubious decision making as his multiversal counterparts that let the pressure get to them. 
On the other hand, however, the fact that the MCU is bringing in this new batch of younger heroes seems to hint at a future schism amongst the marvel heroes ala the comic stories where the young avengers grow disillusioned with their legacy counterparts’ increasingly unethical and anti heroic actions. Kamala Khan in particular is a huge part of this story, as are Wiccan and Speedball, plus our Peter Parker is still young/inexperienced enough (despite having already participated in a universal war, he is still very much in his friendly neighborhood phase) to take the miles morales role of that story.
Honesty, Kamala in particular, with her avengers hero worship, seems to be tailor made for this role of being the true believer that has finally lost faith eventually—as seen in the recent fluster-cluck that was the EA avengers game. 
Counterpoint to the counterpoint: Marvel seems very unwilling to make their top billed MCU characters take on a less-than-heroic persona (Wanda being some kinda dirty in MoM notwithstanding), as evidenced by the nixing of Stark’s infamous demon in a bottle story. Now this point may be the weakest, as I’m sure many fans can (and likely will) point out how dumb I am for forgetting the myriad examples of MCU heroes acting in an anti heroic manner, but it seemed worth pointing out regardless.
I’d love to hear other fans’ thoughts on this, as it would be great to see an MCU-prime/616 Illuminati one day—if only because I won’t be able to die happy until I’ve seen mark ruffalo get a world war hulk story so we can see world breaker hulk in the MCU",Marvel
1655764188,Philotics,Continuity and Ego Infinity Stones Theory,"Half Theory / Half Headcanon on how these two extra Infinity Stones, the Continuity Stone and the Ego Stone, fit in the overall power distribution of the collective Infinity Stones. 

[Continuity and Ego Stones](https://preview.redd.it/kwwum6w2au691.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17c7c573aaac3ce3723ba22940135c2bc13a4469)

**The Continuity Stone:** One of the most common weaknesses of the Infinity Stones is that they only work within their native universe. Each universe of the multiverse is supposed to have their own Infinity Stones but taking one set of Infinity Stones outside its home universe leaves them empty of power. In contrast, Deadpool's Continuity Stone is able to step outside of its own comic and into other continuities without losing power. This stone could have the missing aspect of the Infinity Gauntlet that lets it act on the multiversal axis just like the Space and Time Stones let the Infinity Gauntlet act on the space and time axis. Each universe in the multiverse or each piece of media would be its own continuity that this stone would let the other stones act across. This could also be called narrative power or the power of fate. 

**The Ego Stone:** This one is more headcanon as the Ego Stone is more a vessel for Nemesis but I am going to consider what power the Ego Stone would have on its own and what it could offer that is not covered by the rest of the Infinity Gauntlet. Assuming the Ego Stone has a power like the other Stones, then perhaps it would be possible to use it as a vessel for one's own ego rather than just the ego of Nemesis. Another common weakness of the Infinity Gauntlet is that not everyone is able to wield its power, such as the Stones in the MCU damaging both Thanos and the Guantlet after the snap. Using the Ego Stone could also its wielder to fuse their will with the Infinity Stones, merging with them and even becoming a Cosmic Being like Nemesis. This could cover the weaknesses of wielding the power of the Infinity Stones and having a will capable of conceiving how to use their power. It would also cover a third weakness of the Infinity Stones being able to be taken from you as they would be fused with your very being. The other Infinity Stones cover infinite outward control but the Ego Stone could cover inward self control and will to control the overall power of the Infinity Gems. 

**Other Stones:** The Ultimate Universe is another instance of there naturally being eight infinity stones. As far as I am aware, they are never named or explained, but I will still count that as a win for the Continuity and Ego Stones being a natural part of the Infinity Stone collection. The stone growing inside Tony Stark's head could even fit with being the Ego Stone without Nemesis' ego. Other infinity stones that I have seen do not as naturally meld with the original six Infinity Stones. Both the Death and Rhythm Stones that I have seen are not natural Infinity Stones but fakes created with the Reality Stone. The Lego Build Stone I have not seen much about, but it seems to me like it would just be that universe's name for the Reality Stone. Then lastly, the Battlerealm Stones, the ""Nightmare, Evolution, Genesis, War, Chaos, and Death Stones"", appear to be artificial Infinity Stones as well and though their powers are not delved into much, they seem to act like corrupted versions of the regular Infinity Stones rather than being a true part of the set.

**TLDR:** The Continuity Stone covers the multidimensional weakness of the Infinity Gauntlet and the Ego Stone covers the ability to fully wield the power of the Infinity Gauntlet.",Marvel

1655713758,inklingboi08,My new MCU multiverse theory.,"A multiverse can be comprised of multiple subgroups, just like a universe has clusters and superclusters. So the MCU's multiverse, which as of now (based on all confirmed connections) includes the main Earth-199999/Earth-616, all alternate timelines, the Dark Dimension, Quantum Realm, Nexus of all realities, the cloud monster place from Loki, and all other planes of existence aside from universes, Sony Spidey Verse, Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield films with the alternate timelines for the villains, Earth-838, and all onscreen universes (such as all the ones America and Strange travel through rapidly.) Notice I mentioned the Dark Dimension and Quantum Realm, although I believe all universes in and out of this theoretical ""supercluster"" have those. There is overlap with the comics multiverse, as Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon feature cameos from Tobey and Andrew, but that doesn't completely invalidate this theory, as we can just say superclusters aren't forbidden from interconnecting. It's like an unofficial version of DC's Multi-Multiverse.",Marvel
1655707098,inklingboi08,My problems with the MCU's treatment of the Multiverse.,"My main problem is the blantant ignoring of Earth-199999 as a designation for the MCU. Earth-616 is and has been the mainline comic universe for decades. DECADES. Meaning, there is and has been one Marvel multiverse for decades. This is supported by Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon, which both feature cameos from cartoon and movie characters with their own reality designations.

As Iman Vellani said, if the MCU is Earth-616 then Kamala is an inhuman, and aside from the Inhumans TV series and Black Bolt of Earth-838 (if that really is the true designation, seeing as apparently different universes call other universes different things) they don't exist in the MCU, or at least the Terrigen Bomb which awakened her latent Inhuman genes and powers didn't.

This is unlike DC's Multiverse, which combines the main 52 universes, along with their previous incarnations and variations, with the Dark Multiverse and other Multiverses across all of their media, including the Arrowverse, DCEU, etc, into their Multi-Multiverse, or Omniverse.

The term ""omniverse"" is flawed because it comprises all versions of reality, real and imagined, including ours, which would include the entirety of the Marvel multiverse. However this can be easily explained away.

There are multiple crossover Earths that are therefore part of both the DC and Marvel multiverse, meaning that it can be assumed that the rest of the other publisher's mulitverse exists but is understandably not able to be shown due to ownership and copyright.

So let's say Marvel decides to make their multiverse like this, ignoring 80 years of history. Fine. They still don't know the difference between alternate timeline, possible future, and alternate universe. I am 100% convinced that the writers don't actually read the comics, and get most of their knowledge from the internet.

For example, the timeline Steve returned to in Endgame should theoretically be an alternate timeline to the main 199999 (or 616 as every theory is calling it now, but I refuse). By the logic of Loki, this should be a different universe. So how is Steve able live to be old in the main timeline? This should be a possible future. And while possible futures can be alternate universes, time travel altering the timeline is not a reason.

For example, Earth-928, the 2099 universe, shared an identical history with Earth-616 (the comic one). But one event in ITS timeline caused a change that spiraled into the state it's in now.

Also, I've heard people use America Chavez never seeing a version of herself in another universe as evidence that it's a separate multiverse. But by definition, the multiverse is infinite. She has just yet to visit a universe where another version of herself exists.

I'm also convinced Marvel doesn't fully know its own universes. In NWH, we see villains from the McGuire and Garfield films. However, their history is inconsistent with their counterparts from those films.

Their transport to the MCU was similar to 2099, in that though the universe has a shared history, that event in THEIR timeline caused a new universe to splinter out, without influence from another, unlike Loki would lead you to believe. Time is non linear, so when this universe was created at that point, it had always existed separately.And yet, Marvel treated this as the same universe. Alternate TIMELINE, similar UNIVERSE, but not the same.

This is unlike how Tobey and Andrew appeared in the movie. They were pulled directly from their universe in present time, NOT altering the history, and therefore not creating an alternate timeline.

Anyways, thank you for indulging my rant.",Marvel
1655706375,waterthecan,Pepper/Tony in the comics,"I just learned Pepper and Tony aren't really a thing in the comics which is honestly kinda depressing.

(The only Iron Man comics I've read are a few of the very first ones, so Pepper seemed love-interest-y there but I had no clue before checking her wikipedia page just now about how it ended up given I never read past that. I'm honestly so confused on the whole resurrection of characters thing but I'll make a separate post for that later when I get the guts to.

The Author once tried to kill himself with a bullet which killed Tyler Durden (Bruce Banner tried to do the same) which leads me to my next question. What if the Author adapted the personality of Bruce Banner after shooting himself? And lived out the rest of his life practicing science (which he already knew a bit about) it's entirely possible that the actor change from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo in the MCU was also a reference to the fact that the Author can perceive himself in any physical image.

1655550736,Old_Mill,"This is a long shot, but I am looking for a very specific comic panel from a Spider-Man comic.","Long story short, when I was a kid in the mid early to mid 2000's there I went to a library and there was a big black and white book of Spider-Man comics. From what I know about comics now this must have been a collection of reprints, given it was in black and white. I assume it has to be from The Amazing Spider-Man, *maybe* Spectacular Spider-Man, but I don't know much about if they made any big reprint books of those, especially in black and white. I assume it can't be Ultimate Spider-Man despite the popularity at the time given how new the series was, I very much doubt they had any black and white reprints of it then, if they even have them now.

So, I have given the backstory I can and my speculation, from my memory, this is what the actual panel was: 

I assume Spider-Man was sneaking around and spying on someone. I just remember he was probably on a wall spying on someone because the specific thing I remember is he said, **""Gloves don't leave finger prints""**. That is the only concrete thing I remember for sure, I think he may have been being accused of something, but that part could be completely wrong. 

This is why I said it is a long shot, I can't remember much other than the time period, **(mid-2000's)** and he said **""Gloves don't leave finger prints.""**

Watching them back to back, there were a couple of weird plot holes that seem like inconsistencies, but I'm guessing were just deleted scenes that were never explained.  Does anyone know the answers to these?

&amp;#x200B;

1. In Infinity War, after Thor makes Stormbreaker, Thor/Groot/Rocket are teleported to Wakanda in the middle of the battle via the Bifrost.  However at the beginning of the movie, Heimdall is killed and uses the Bifrost Sword one last time to teleport Hulk back to earth to warn the Avengers.  If Heimdall is dead and the Bifrost Sword is still on the ship in space, how did they teleport? (Thor clearly didn't have it, as he had to travel via space ship to Nidavellir)
2. In Endgame, Valkyrie and a decent chunk of Asgardians are on Earth.  How did they get there, when the Asgardians were shown as killed by Thanos in Infinity War?
3. At the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 1, there's a big deal made of the Guardians saving Xandar &amp; giving the Power Stone to the Nova Corps for safekeeping - even going so far as to show John C Reilly's character reuniting with his wife and kids.  Then Xandar is destroyed off panel in Infinity War, meaning it's sort of the Guardian's fault that they left the Infinity Gem there.  Is this ever touched on?  Maybe something for Guardians 3?
4. How come the rat that frees Scott Lang from the quantum realm doesn't get any cred?  That rat is single handedly responsible for defeating Thanos!  Otherwise Scott would be trapped in the quantum realm forever and there would be no Endgame :)",Marvel
1655486911,Lostlight_awesome_04,How did Vulcan survived at the end of WoK(War of kings),"So a little while ago I was doing some rereading of some past X-men stories written in the 2000s because I was shocked to learn there was actually a 3rd Summers brother aka Gabriel Summers(Vulcan) which suprised because he was such an obscure character that I didn't knew existed. So I decided to do some research and read story arcs regarding this 3rd Summers brother, what I found interesting is that at the end War of Kings, Vulcan was severly injured by Black Bolt to the point where what's left of him are bones and muscles yet somehow and also he lost his prosthetic eye which replaced the one he loses to Gladiator. But the next time we see him in the Krakoa X-men era he was as good as new like there was no damage done to him, and according to his memories it doesn't seem like he was severly injured during his time trapped in the vault. While I don't know how is this possible there are some few gusses:

1. As stated in his Marvel database page, while Vulcan can manipulate energy to heal himself, his power were not strong enough to the point where he can regenerate lost portions of his body such as losing his eye to Gladiator. So it could be possible that Vulcan's healing power elevated to a regeneration level allowing him to regenerate his whole body, but that seems less likely possible unless the writers decided to change that.
2. The second guess is that he somehow transformed himself into pure energy and merged with black bolt before being extracted by the eldritch beings in the Vault. Now this theory was suggested about 2 years ago by a comic book reader rereading some of Hickman's run for the FF #6 and spotted the drawings are exactly mirrored the ones in 2019 X-men #8, and since how Black Bolt escaped the Vault was never explained to us we can guess something must have happened between the two(The link for the theory:[https://twitter.com/abyssalodin/status/1237784453230891009?s=21](https://twitter.com/abyssalodin/status/1237784453230891009?s=21))
3. The third guess is or what I believe is the most reasonable answer is that during the end of War of Kings, Vulcan and Black Bolt did indeed died in the end of King of Wars, however at the end of their battle, both fell into the Vault, and doing some research the some called Vault Vulcan was trapped in was actually the Cancerverse. If you don't know what the Cancerverse is, it's basically a reality in which Death no longer exists thus nobody can die in that universe and it is being invaded by cthulu or eldritch beings. Due to its unique property of lacking the concept of death, even if you're from another reality once you die in this universe, you will be completely healed and revived there, this has been proven in [*Guardians of the Galaxy* Vol 3 #18](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_18)\-19. When Star Lord use the cosmic cube successfully obliterating Thanos to ashes,  only for Thanos to remerge seconds later and kill Quill, then not so far away from his place of death Quill was also completely revived and healed, with no signs of injuries. Therefore I believe that by the end of WoK both actually died, but due to them dying in a universe where death doesn't exist they both got instantly revived and healed of all previous permanent injuries, explaining why when we later saw Vulcan reappeared in 2019 Hickman's X-men run there was no sign of his scar or his prophetic eyeball.

1655404059,Jorgesgorge1977,Miss my comics,"I see a lot of people sharing old comics on here… here’s my story. So I began collecting comics when I was seven. My grandparents owned a small variety store and every weekend, I’d go work Saturdays and Sundays. It was menial tasks such as stock the cans, wipe down shelving, stack newspapers. But every time I’d finish, my grandmother would let me pick one comic, a chocolate milk, and a chocolate bar. So over a year I’d collected quite a few and this went on for five plus years. But when I was ten, I’d gone to my other grandparents with my father, and my uncle was cleaning junk out of his old room. I use junk as a loose term here, as he had milk crates full of comics from the late sixties/early seventies. I asked if I could have them hand he said yup and gave them all to me. So by the time I was ten, I had  1000’s of comics and mostly marvel. 

Some of the comics I had were:

Avengers #1 

Incredible Hulk #1 

Fantastic four- first time with Dr. Doom 

Spider-Man- first time with the punisher (for that I had the original and the reprint from the 90’s 

Anyways all of these comics were in bags with cardboard backing, and at least 65% were in fair to good shape. We’ll fast forward twenty years and my basement floods while my wife and I are gone on vacation. Those comics by the time we got home were destroyed, and by destroyed I mean mulch. In the plastic bags they’d basically just deteriorated into nothingness? Contact my insurance company, and they told me without proof of the price of them, they could only give me the bottom price on all. Pretty sure I was sitting on approx 50k worth of comics, and ended up getting 5k for the insurance money and that included other property that got ruined. I miss my comics, so thanks for sharing.

1655309816,The_GOAT_Himself,How Endgame will play out if the other half got dusted,"Just a quick FYI that this is technically not my idea I just found it very interesting and am passing it on. I saw this based on a video. I also am going to try to keep this as close to the original events of Endgame as possible

So the first thing we need to know is who got dusted. And in this scenario the following got dusted.

* Captain America
* Thor
* Black Widow
* Hulk
* Rocket Racoon
* War Machine
* Okoye
* Iron Man
* Captain Marvel
* Hawkeye
* Nebula

And these are the following that survived.

* Black Panther
* Spiderman
* Dr. Strange
* Bucky Barnes
* Scarlet Witch
* Falcon
* Wasp
* Star Lord
* Drax
* Mantis
* Groot
* Shuri
* Ant Man
* Nick Fury
* Hank Pym
* Janet Van Dyne
* Maria Hill
* Wong

Now there are two loopholes to this. The first is Thanos who will be unsnapped in this scenario for reasons and the second is Ant-Man. Ant-Man was originally snapped off in the video but in my version he stays.

Before the time heist  Dr. Strange teleports the Avengers on Titan to the Avengers compound and the ones in Wakanda will fly to the Avengers base.  To get to Thanos Shuri will track the energy signatures of the infinity stones to Titan and to get there they can use the Benetaur or Black Panther sponsors a Wakandan ship to get there. After they learn that Thanos destroyed the stones Scarlet Witch will kill Thanos or maybe they bring him back as prisoner.

After the 5 year jump Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne bring back Ant Man who suggests time travel. The Avengers are on board the time heist begins.

Of course with Hank Pym around they can easily make pym particles and Scott Lang suggests using he Quantam Realm. With the combined efforts of Shuri, Hank, and Janet the time machine is born.

In this scenario the unsnapped Avengers will go to the following places to gather the infinity Stones.

* Morag (2014)
* Knowhere
* Vormir
* New York (2012)

So let's start with Morag. In this scenario Star Lord and Spiderman will go to Morag to collect the power stone. The two Peters will bond by talking about movies or something. Of course during this time Gamora is still alive and when Star Lord sees her he will get  all emotional and idiotic resulting in the 2014 Thanos capturing him. Meanwhile Spiderman makes it back with the Power stone.

Now let's move on to New York 2012. In this scenario Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Bucky will go after the Time, Mind, and Space stones. Dr. Strange gets the time stone from the ancient one no problem. Maybe the ancient one can give a few tips on executing the time heist better. Bucky will go after the Mind Stone and will fight the 2012 Steve Rogers. Black Panther, Ant-Man, and the Wasp will go after the space stone but one thing happens after another and Loki takes the Tesseract and dips.

Because of the Tesseract incident Dr. Strange and Black Panther go to Asgard 2013 to steal the Space stone from Odin's Vault. You know Thor was too drunk to point this out but the Tesseract was taken to Asgard after the battle of NY.

Using the Benotaur or a Wakandan ship Shuri, Scarlet Witch, and Falcon will go to Knowhere to steal the reality stone from the collector. Shuri will get a ton of inspiration from the space journey.

Finally we get to Vormir. In this scenario Drax, Mantis, and Groot will go to get the soul stone. Of course on Vormir one has to sacrifice something they love to get the stone. So Drax will die as he never really did anything else before the time heist and he never had any motivation besides avenging his family. The Guardians of the Galaxy are family and Drax’s death would motivate them to push their cause and also it would give Drax an interesting point of view. Groot and Mantis make it back.

Now the 2014 Thanos has to make it back to the present. Thanos will learn about his future through Star Lord’s point of view. He then uses Star Lord’s pym particles to transport him, his army, and Star Lord to the present. Star Lord will then convince Gamora to switch sides.

Now its time for the snap itself.  Shuri will make the infinity gauntlet out of vibranium. Now who will snap the gauntlet? Without Thor, Captain Marvel, and Hulk there really isn't that many people who can take the force of the infinity gauntlet. Dr. Strange is a good contender but I don't think he is durable enough to take the force. Rather I think Scarlet witch will snap the gauntlet to bring everyone back. Wanda's powers were enhanced by the mind stone so it makes the most sense in my opinion. Wanda survives but is traumatized by the affects of the Gauntlet. 

 Thanos attacks and the portal scene in endgame takes place. After this everything is the same as the original timeline.

1655284307,Funnie_Croc,MORBIUS and MONSOON,"“Hey,” Red mumbled, standing behind Cyan as he tried to tap two differently coloured wires together.

Cyan didn’t turn, but nodded in acknowledgement. “Hey yourself.”

He was engrossed enough in his task to not feel Red’s arms slip around his body and press his hands onto his ribs, and he didn’t notice, not until Red gently took the zipper at his collarbone and started pulling it down.

And as well as that, Red’s helmet was similar to a gas mask, so Cyan could feel his warm breath against his neck, and it made him shiver.

“... Ok, what are you doing.”

“Mmh. Nothing.”

As he started to register what was happening, Cyan thought about fighting back, but then he realised how badly he actually wanted- no, needed this.

I mean, come on, they’d all been on the same ship for seven weeks, and Cyan wasn’t desperate enough to wanna touch them (except sometimes he’d come in his pants like some sort of teenager reading Demetri comments on Reddit whenever he thought too much about Red).

Besides, Cyan did find Red kind of hot, and he was pretty touch-starved-

“If you wanna fuck me,” Cyan huffed almost impatiently, closing the wire panel as he finished the task just then and turned around to face Red, “then just say it.”

“Fine,” Red grunted, pinning Cyan to the wall. “I wanna fuck you. Hard.”

Cyan yelped in surprise when Red’s tendrils grabbed his wrists and yanked them above his helmet.

“And I want you screaming for me.”

“So. Leeches-” Green began, but then Yellow cut him off.

“We are NOT having this discussion again.”

White glanced across the table and at the pair, amused. “Aw come on, let the man speak - he has a point.”

“Shut up, you rip-off Hitler.”

“Fight me, suka—”

He grunted as Blue gently swatted his head, frowning in annoyance.

“Don’t be mean,” he mumbled. “besides, where’s Red and Cyan? It’s spaghetti today, and they both love it.”

“Maybe we can find them on the cameras?” Green suggested.

Then, as if in a silent agreement, everybody stood up, left their plates, and started towards the camera room.

Blue went ahead of them, entering the room first and turning them on-

And then surprised everybody by letting out some sort of noise of exclamation.

“Er. What is it, comrade-”

The other three froze as they stared up into the screen - and watched in surprise as Red fucked Cyan into the wall.

They all let out a collective ‘oh’ as Green fell backwards and passed out.

“O-oh fucking h e l l —” Blue covered his eyes over his helmet, while Yellow continued staring, reaching down to poke Green awake.

“We- we should probably t-turn the monitor off and-”

“No.”

Blue stared at White, sputtering and steaming madly. “What do you m e a n, no?”

“I mean, ‘no’. This could be... Good research.”

Green finally woke up, and was blushing so hard that you could actually see the blush pass his helmet. “I- so we’re just gonna watch while they-”

“Fuck, that’s- kind of hot.” Yellow whispered, shaking a bit.

So without further ado, they all proceeded to watch the cameras without hesitation.

Cyan whined shamelessly, body quaking with excitement as Red’s stupidly long and slimy tongue wrapped around his length.

The scientist almost felt ashamed that he was enjoying this so much - he used to be one hell of a Dom before, and now he was nothing short of a writhing bitch under Red’s control.

Control.

The word stood out in his mind, hands clenching into fists as he THOUGHT he felt teeth, a heated grunt bubbling from his throat when his ears were filled with the sweet sounds of Red’s own moans around his member.

“Oh, Red,” Cyan gasped out. “please Red, please-“

He already felt his climax coming to hit him like a bat agains a baseball, his cherry ready to pop any second now, and he braced himself to cry out passionately-

When Red just.

Stopped.

His tongue removed itself from his member, and he got up, now level with Cyan, who was quivering with both utter rage and pure bliss.

“Not yet,” He heard Red whisper huskily as he reached down for his own zipper. “I wanna feel good too.”

Cyan was helpless - all he was able to do was whimper as the alien in front of him grab his own cock and start to circle the tip with his thumb.

He pressed his left elbow into the wall, right next to his head, panting softly as he jacked himself off.

Cyan struggled against the tentacles now, desperate to come, he was s o fucking close, but they were too strong; Red moaned a bit louder now, setting a quicker pace as he felt a feeling similar to having warm honey poured into his veins.

And then he came, the cum spurting in thick ropes over Cyan’s own member, aggravating him even further.

“Fuck’s s a k e, Red, lemme come already—”

And he yelled in absolute blinding pleasure as Red grabbed his dick and squeezed it, fisting and milking him for all it was worth, as Cyan practically choked on his own sobs, body wracking with them.

When Red’s tentacles finally let go of his now achingly sore wrists, he collapsed onto his big body, gasping for breath.

“Mm...” Red hummed, embracing Cyan lovingly. “You did so well, love...”

“L-love?” Cyan chuckled shakily, hugging back. “Well, if... You insist.”

Almost instantly did he drift to sleep.",Marvel

1655266440,Hungry-san,I am so lost. Can someone help me figure out what happened in Thor 2007?,"I was reading about some scheme with Asgard in Latveria, Doctor Doom and Loki and suddenly so much happened off camera.

Donald Blake got attacked off-screen by Doombots, something called the Norn Stones suddenly sparked a war against Asgard, Norman Osborne who never appeared on camera launched a war against Asgard, Volskagg or Thor (the comic contradicts itself) destroyed Chicago but it was all fake... And also happened off-screen.

1655258788,TonyMitty,"Are there any Marvel Comics ""Light Novels"" as one would find in manga IPs?"," So I've recently gotten into actually purchasing and reading comics, I've bought a couple of collection books which are SOO COOL.  But it got me thinking.  Coming to comics after years of anime, after watching which I made a collection out of buying the Volume 1 of whatever my favorite series were, why don't Marvel or DC for that matter make light novels, or are they just rarities I can't spot at my local book store?",Marvel
1655257185,Clebcalb,"If Earth is to Galactus as a Big Mac is to a normal man, Galactus would still only be 1/3 as tall as the Sun.","Sometimes when I think about Galactus, I think it’s stupid how huge he is sometimes portrayed as being , that he could hold the whole earth in his hand. That would make him incredibly large. But after seeing a picture of the earth compared to the sun, it got me pondering just how huge the universe really is. So I did some math to figure out how Galactus would compare to the sun, if he could literally eat the earth like a Big Mac. (I know he usually uses machines to convert the planets to energy, but I’ve still seen him portrayed as big enough to actually eat them.)
Here’s the math:

A Big Mac is 2 inches tall, according to Google. Assuming a 6-foot man, this puts a man at 36 Big Macs tall.
The Earth’s diameter is approximately 7917 miles. So if Big Mac:Man = Earth:Galactus, we should multiply Earth’s diameter by 36 to find Galactus’ height.
That yields 285,012 miles as G’s height
The sun’s diameter is 865,370 miles. That is almost exactly 3 times the height we calculated for Galactus.

So, while he would still be ENORMOUS, don’t get me wrong, Galactus would still be dwarfed by the Sun. I don’t know why this was interesting to me, but I hope it was for you too. Sometimes it’s just cool to think about how huge our universe really is.

Here are some bonus comparisons:
At this scale, compared to Galactus,
-The moon would be the size of a skittle.
-Saturn would be about 1/4 his height.
-UY Scuti, the largest known star, has a diameter so large that even at Galactus’ scale, it would be nearly 6 miles long.",Marvel

1655043562,AffectionateWeb7803,The Hulk in Endgame is a great analogy for mental health and therapy,"  I have seen lots of references to mental health with other characters, but I have had this theory that one of the most important themes with mental health for this phase of Marvel was Smart Hulk. 

We all know Hulk is rage, and in Infinity War Hulk didn’t want to come out and this led to a battle with Banner who then had to use one of the Hulk Buster suits to participate in the battles. 

In Endgame when we first saw Smart Hulk in the diner he says:  

“For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in the gamma lab; I put the brains and the brawn together... and now, look at me. **Best of both worlds**.” 

This is important because now we have Hulk’s strength AND Banners intelligence at one time which was imperative for the Avengers’ success. When it was time for someone to snap their fingers, only Hulk could do it and survive. If Hulk was in his rage form, without Banner's mind, he would not be able to cognitively control himself to bring everyone back. 

We know from how Stark died that no one else would be able to survive, maybe Thor, but he was dealing with his own grief and as Stark said: 

“It’s not just that that glove is channelling enough energy to light up a continent, I’m telling you. you’re in no condition”.  

I’m currently watching that part as I type, and you can even see Banner/Hulk thinking about what he must do and what it could do to him. 

For me, this is the perfect analogy for mental health and therapy. It is really difficult having a mental heal diagnosis we can’t control, and oftentimes feel like it controls us. But through therapy and spending some time getting to understand and know ourselves better, we may be able to become a better version of ourselves. Like Banner and Hulk did in the gamma lab.

Personally, I was diagnosed with OCD 8 years ago. While it sucks to have intrusive thoughts and compulsions. A “good” part of it is intense focus and almost becoming obsessed with thoughts or a goal or “if I don’t do this other thing will happen”. Through therapy and lots of difficult EPR, I can focus that energy on really big goals. While I work on not becoming obsessed with that goal, I do feel I can use some extra mental processing and problem solving to overcome obstacles.  

I have friends with other mental health challenges expressing similar sentiments after therapy or medication. Not at all speaking for everyone, but it is always an interesting conversation, and I have wanted to share this idea of Hulk and therapy for a long time.

1654984314,No_Show_6634,Help before Secret Wars comic (2015),"Hello, I’m a marvel fan since I have memory. I pick up the comics of the characters that interest me and usually before an MCU debut of a character I didn’t know much about I read the essentials. I love 616 but I’ve never read Secret Wars 2015, I don’t know why but well, now I want to and I know it’s a big story so I’m gonna read some stuff before. I haven’t read absolutely every issue since the 60’s but pretty much there with Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Daredevil, X-Men, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Thor, Kamala Khan a lot of Avengers and West Coast, New Avengers etc. And many others I’m really familiar with. I’ve read a lot of 616 post Secret Wars with events and characters I love so I’m catch up I know about the world ending and rebooting but now I want to go back and read Secret Wars this cause as I said I don’t know why I haven’t done it yet and I want to experience the whole thing. Also read some of the preludes like in Ms Marvel last days. This is a list of events and issues that what I’ve come up with looking in the internet with different reading orders to catch up pre Secret Wars. Some of those I’ve already read but I want to have them fresh in my memory. I also plan on reading the Ultimate Universe before.

Basically I would really appreciate all your expertise Marvel fans of this sub to tell me if there are some more issues and events that I’ve missed that would improve my experience reading Secret Wars. It’s gonna be long but I hope it’s worth it. I would also appreciate if you told me which Secret Wars tie ins and BattleWorld issues are the best for you, when I read an event I usually only read the tie ins for the series I’m following, I’ve read everything for Civil War for example and it was too much. I’ve read the Thors one when I read Aaron’s Thor and liked it so if you guys tell me the best tie ins I’ll listen. Thank you! Have a good day if you don’t have suggestions. 


What I plan on reading is:

- Ultimate Universe
- Maybe reread 1602 if I have time 


-Earth 616:

-60’s Fantastic Four (essential issues ig)
-Secret Wars 1 (reread)
-Secret Wars 2
-Infinity Gauntlet/War/Crusade (reread)

-Invincible Iron Man (2006)
-Captain America (Brubaker)
-Secret War
-Civil War (reread)
-One More Day (reread)
-World War Hulk
-Secret Invasion 
-Dark Reign
-Siege (reread)
-Infinity (reread)
-Superior Iron Man 
-FF / Fantastic 4 (Hickman)
-Amazing Spider-Man 2014-2015
-The Incursions (avengers - new avengers)
-Time Runs Out

-Secret Wars 2015

- Tie Ins I’m gonna read (editing the post with your suggestions) : Spider-Man Renew your Vows, Thors (reread).



TL;DR: Give me suggestions before Secret Wars 2015 to enjoy the event more and also suggest your favorite Ti Ins and battleworld issues to read along with the event. Thanks!",Marvel

 it is based on the origin of him taking the super soldier serum being fake as sentry  is a reality warper so his origin could be what ever he believes it is at any given time so i extened that concept

so the theory i have is that the world of marvel is the way it is cuz of the sentry as he wants to play hero and  save the day right so what better way to play hero than to have a world  full of heroes and villains to go on fantastical adventures with and  save the multiverse

so his powers make it so  as sentry has next to no control of his reailty warping powers so my theory is a possibility at least

Since both entities seem to wear helmets that seem similar to one another, how apparently Galan (before Galactus became Galactus) was one of the last remaining humanoid species in the universe.

In my opinion I find it interesting to believe that Galan was purposely put in that position to become one with that dying universe becoming galactus and then becoming the next one over.  


I know this is completely crack-pot considering that Eternity exists and other eternities do with no reference to Galatus or them being Galatus like beings, but I think its nifty!

I understand that in the movie Eternals the Character was recast as female, but when tried to research the comic character,  the most recent references I find online tell me that the character died in a previous story arc.

Given that death is really just a temporary inconvenience for most Eternals I am sure they just did the standard ""OH look, yet another character back from the dead"" and explained the gender issue as a minor detail change like a Time Lord's regeneration.   

Does anyone know when they changed Ajak's gender in the comics?  I just want to see so I can know when it changed with respect to the release of the movie.

1654857272,DasEmperor,My thoughts on the first episode of Captain Marvel,"It's visually stunning! The scene where they're texting is so good, and I like the info dumps. The visual style in info dumping is so good I want more exposition.

In terms of writing, this could be any given show aimed at teenagers. The statement ""it's not the brown girl from Jersey City saving the world"" feels less apt though. I mean, technically she's right, but it's the brown girl from central Africa, and another one from Egypt, and a brown Jewish guy from somewhere in like Eastern USA, and there's a wildly diverse group of people in Ant Man, and they don't all put on the suit but they've contributed to saving the world at one point or another- that statement would be really strong in 2012, I don't know about 2022. 

I like how good they were at showing language and culture in a way that didn't feel isolated. This is a family that lives in New Jersey from India, but it's not a show where the only people are Muslim Urdu speakers, it's a show that depicts a minority family that hasn't cultural isolated themselves. It's not bad!

1654810168,inklingboi08,Can someone help me compile a list of all of the spider totems?,"
I'm trying to compile a list of every Spider related issue. The Marvel wiki has been a great help, but it isn't perfect. I already can find what I believe are all of the issues featuring every version of Peter, Miles, Kaine, Ben, and any other spider person who goes by ""Spider-Man"", under the Spider-Man Comic Books category. However, I need help with the other characters. Off the top of my head, I can think of Peter, Miles, Kaine, Ben, May, Gwen, Silk, Anya, and Otto (which is included with Peter I guess). However, I know there are probably others in mainline continuity and in alternate realities. Specifically for the latter, I know there are characters that aren't spiders in mainline continuity but are in alternate universes, like Spider UK. Can anybody help me out on this?",Marvel
1654809135,BeansWereHere,What do none Muslims and not Pakistanis think about the Ms Marvel show?,"To preface this I am a Muslim Pakistani, I am also 16. I just watched the episode and it had lots of references to Pakistani culture and Islam that I think would go over the western audiences heads, surprising there was also a decent amount of Urdu spoken by the characters. My question is are none Pakistani/Muslims enjoying the show? It feels like it’s targeting a specific niche, and to be honest the representation is good but not great so far. Some stuff is over exaggerated, although admittedly a lot of it is close to reality and is decently relatable to a 16 yr old Pakistani boy. I just don’t see how western audiences would enjoy the show. But please tell me otherwise.",Marvel

To compare it to the movie is interesting because what The Filmmakers did was pretty much they kept all the essential thematic concepts and origin story aspects in terms of their purpose and being created by the celestials but they streamlined it as best they could and they did a modern reinvention like an ultimate comics type of updating which is fine because if you were to make a race of super beings to help evolve humanity youd want them to look like all of humanity the only change I don't like but I understand the artistic reasoning behind it is they changed the deviants.

1654728394,lord_of_memeingtown,A Question about Moon Knight's Jewish representation in the MCU,"I'm going to start off by saying I loved Moon Knight and all the shows and movies I'm gonna mention.

In Black panther, a big part of the film was exploring and referencing sub-Saharan African and black culture and it was a big reason why it resonated so well with audiences, with Ms. Marvel ep1 we can see that a big part of the show is going to be revolving round Pakistani and Muslim culture (and I love it I think it gives her character depth). so why then when Marvel uses it's Jewish characters do they re-write them as white instead of Jewish (eg. spiderman, scarlet witch)?

When Moon Knight was announced I thought there's no way they can write all his roots out, and I was right (Kind of). They re-wrote why he has DID, not because of anti-Semitic attacks, not because he watched his synagogue burn down but because his mother beat him as a child. They wrote-out a big driving force of his character, being a Jew who serves an Egyptian god. The only real reference we got to his Jewish roots was that his mother had a funeral and if you squint he can sometimes be seen wearing a star of David.

there was that one scene when Layla was asked if she was an Egyptian superhero (which by the way again loved it, thought it fit the character perfectly as well as completing some form of arc about her relationship with Egypt) that summed the whole thing up perfectly, why wasn't there a Jewish moment like that? Why was moon Knight written to be solely an exploration of Egypt and not be Jewish the same way as Ms. Marvel or black panther, or even Egypt in moon knight? Why do Jewish characters always get whitewashed? Was anyone else disappointed by this because I kind of feel robbed.",Marvel

1654685169,TonyMitty,"How do the comics square the concept of mutants with the world at large, vis a vis history and population numbers?","I will preface this by saying that my knowledge of the finer bits of the X-men continuity is limited to the movies and some highlighted story beats.  The best explanation I currently have is as follows:  mutants have been around since humanity began (Apocalypse and his original 4 horsemen), but populations spiked (coincidentally) around nuclear bomb testing in the 60s (?) post WW2 (Magneto's whole history if it hasn't been changed).  The world saw an increasing population of scary and powerful people as a threat, several extermination plots were prevented as Professor X and his merry band of students and helpers tried to convince the world that mutant-kind was not a threat, while Magneto and his side tried to take things over with mutants as a superior race.  Phoenix force, yada yada, now mutants are immortal living on an isolated mutant-only island with the goal of protecting their own and being left alone (Hellfire gala subtitles seeming to say they are going to take a more active role in the world). Please correct me if I'm wrong.  

My main question is, if a not-insignificant portion of the world was mutant, that would be literally ALL THE WORLD WOULD CARRY ABOUT, so how big is the ""mutant problem"" compared to everything else going on in the Marvel universe? Forget the Avengers and Thor and aliens when your neighbor can teleport through walls and your mailman's son can shoot bone spurs from his elbows.

How large were mutant populations to justify genocide yet not be the sole focus of the universe? Is this just one of those things that gets brushed over as universes began to collide as comic book writers started crossing characters over, or is there a justification as to why Stark wasn't involved in anti-mutant military weapons, or why Captain America wasn't put on an anti-mutant detail one of the many times he was thawed out in the moving timeline?  How big is it compared to things like the Inhuman outbreak?",Marvel

1654665909,xNephilim,Recommend me some Moon Knight comics,"Bought Marvel Unlimited to read some Moon Knight stuff, I read the one where his personalities are Cap, Spider Man and Wolverine last night.

1654663478,ArugulaGazebo,Is there anywhere left for the MCU to explore conceptually?,"Hey everyone,

It should go without saying that I love the MCU movies and I'm not trying to critique.

I kind of have an existential concern for the franchise. Part of what made the MCU movies so appealing to non-comic book fan audiences, besides just being great movies in general, was that the movies did a great job of adapting comic book style story telling into movie format (foreshadowing, cross overs, serialized stories, ""events,"" etc.). This type of story telling was immensly well received, climaxing with Endgame, which I think is an appitome of the type of comic story telling they had been doing. Foreshadowing and building towards ""event movies"" (you could say) is something unique to this series and what has kept movie fans invested for all those years during the Infinity Saga.

The problem is how many different types of events can you do without becoming redundant? Like if Marvel decided to build towards another big baddie essentially an analog for Thanos, like God Doom or maybe even Kang, I don't think people would care as much. It would inevitably just be compared to Infinity War and Endgame. I guess unless the stakes of the story were pretty different.

I feel like the most comic story tropes have been used already, because there has already been such a great variety of stories already told in the MCU, conceptually is there much else to explore with these comic style stories?

I am kind of doubtful. Even with superhero comics we see the stories usually follow certain tropes and storylines. The interesting ones have variations, but it is kind of similar nonetheless and the people that really enjoy these stories become the comic book fans. When this happens (some may think it already has) with the movies, the perception among movie fans probably will be that the next upcoming film is just another ""marvel movie"" instead of the next exciting blockbuster film!

What can they do about this? Not sure if they can recapture the magic of the Infinity Saga again, but they can keep creating quality films. Maybe get experimental like how some comics are, recent films have kind of been doing this. Does that defeat the purpose of having an interconnected series? Kind of, but the movies can't be propped up with that as the gimmick.

I hope they can continue their success in bringing crazy comic book concepts and stories to the big screen! Including some more awesome event movies. I was hoping for a House of M Avengers movie, as I thought that would be unique enough and Elizabeth Olsen is a great actress, but I doubt we are getting that now because we kind of already did get it. Secret Invasion could be really tense, but there are some similarities to Winter Solder. Original Sin could be a good way to do an event but keep it character centric?

God bless if you read through my rambly thoughts. I got thinking about this because I am excited for the upcoming Thor movie, but have not been as interested in the Disney+ stuff and some of the phase 4 movies. I'm not expecting cinema history to be broken with Thor 4, but I like Chris Hemsworth's take and I am hoping to see more of the Norse mythology stuff from the comics in it. Ultimately, I think this will be the forseeable future of the MCU's appeal, more individual character centric.

TLDR:
I feel like adaptation of comic book story telling to film is what made the MCU uniquely appealing and got people excited to follow along as we hadn't seen that with films before. But that can't be a selling point forever or else it becomes a gimmick which defeats some of the purpose of the MCU. Instead they should focus on just making good superhero movies. Superhero stories have their tropes and usually follow similar plots, so unfortunately it might just be considered more of the same and just another ""marvel movie,"" then superhero movies might become kind of niche again. But I hope Marvel can continue their success in making new movies with events or C-D list characters and make them unique and compelling enough to be popular.",Marvel

So, the process goes like this:

Future Sinister learns something past Sinister needs to know. He uploads the info to a Moira clone, kills a Moira clone, and then Sinister activates the X-gene from a baby Moira (or several?) to get the info, Sinister downloads it, and he knows what happens in the future. 

So, my questions are as follows:

1) Are these future Sinisters done when the Moira clone dies? Does the timeline essentially collapse and end with her death, or it is essentially like Sinister claps his hands and says ""I know that'll come in handy for past me!"" and keep going?

2) If he is getting information from future timelines that end once Moira dies, wouldn't he receive all the information immediately once he first set up this game of Moira Telephone?

1654346242,EldritchFairyHero,"From the perspective of the 616 continuity, what's the point of Age of Apocalypse?","Not a rhetorical question, I genuinly sincerely would like this question to be answered.  


To give some context (can skip down to where it says **\*SKIP\*** if you don't care), I am in the process of physically collecting all the most important and significant of the classic X-Men comics to fill out the important details of their 616 continuity and put it in chronological order. And, some of them are even more modern retellings of either already told or untold stories.  


In chronological order, they are: X-Men Season One, Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, God Loves Man Kills, Mutant Massacre... and, well, the Age of Apocalypse Omnibus most recently, after saving up money for that monstrosity.  


**\*SKIP\***  
So either way, I have already been skimming through the pages of X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse, and read up the plot synopsis and stuff like that... and I realize it's set in ""a twisted version of the world they knew"", Earth-295... and, it's about Bishop fixing the timeline to get back to Earth-616 again?  


So... it's like Flashpoint of DC Comics, but instead of Flash it's Bishop? In other words, absolutely NOTHING happens in this comic that matters to 616 continuity, other than maybe the fact that Bishop remembers it all?  


The reason I am confused about this is because I've been told COUNTLESS of times that X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse is THE definitive Apocalypse story to demonstrate what type of character he is, what his background is, and what his powers are. Have I been decieved?  


I would really, REALLY appreciate people's inputs on this. It's bad enough that it's a ridiculously huge omnibus that feels daunting to get into, and it's also bad enough that it's filled with bad 90s artwork - but now I also hesitate to even read it because it doesn't seem like anything in it even matters.  


And just a disclaimer lastly: I'm not saying the story is going to be bad. I'm sure it'll be great... or not, I really have no idea. But I collect these comics because I care about the characters and the world-building for the 616 continuity.",Marvel

The whole dying and reincarnation is one thing that bothers me, more so when we've had past x stories dealing with the after life, makes it feel (to me) that the reincarnations are more lile clones and my fave mutants are probably dead.

I'm more bothered Hickman's left it, something that I was always content with the series (despite my not enjoying it) was Hickman once stated in an interview that he likes to write this like taking all the toys out the toybox but putting them back after he's played with them so they are back to how they were left when he found them.

1654275944,MagicJoshByGosh,Unpopular opinion: I wish Marvel deaths were permanent,"Well, okay, let me elaborate: I wish character deaths in Marvel Comics were permanent *for the most part.* I mean, yeah, in a few cases it makes sense for the character to come back, I get it. But a lot of the best storylines involve a main character dying — Death of Spider-Man, Dark Phoenix Saga, Death of Captain Marvel, The Night Gwen Stacy Died, and many others included. All of those stories I listed involve someone (Ultimate Spider-Man, Jean Grey, Mar-Vell the original Captain Marvel, Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn) being killed for real. The only characters that came back were Jean and Norman, and they came back after *at least* a couple decades.

No, this is not me saying that I wish Captain America’s assassination at the end of Civil War was permanent. I’m saying I wish it didn’t happen.

Now, again, I will agree that there are a select few storylines that benefit from a character being resurrected, or a retcon rewriting their death as “being teleported to the Negative Zone,” or “I faked my death to protect you from harm,” or whatever weird explanation they give. Hell, even the Clone Saga brought back Gwen for a second saying that she was actually a clone. But I wish those cases were few and far between.

That’s one of the reasons why I think the Ultimate Universe is under-appreciated. Most everyone’s deaths in the Ultimate Universe were permanent. Death had an impact on the story because it was an *actual* threat. I like that kind of story.

The Scarlet Witch, while tearing through the Illuminati in a magic-child-induced rage, engaged in conversation with Mr. Fantastic (which shouldn'tve happened, and seemed out of character for her since she was already in that deep), who explained that black bolt could easily destroy her with a single word, which is completely true.

He, for some reason, flexes and smiles. LITERALLY WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?? That is so out of character for him! He literally never acts cocky any other time, even apologizing while killing alternate Dr. Strange!

1654229739,Qpika,"What were your annoyances, likes, cringes, things learned, etc.?","\-All of this because of a femcel (correct term?)... ALL OF IT! The whole jist of the movie predicated on a angry PMS Omega level woman with the Darkhold that wants to be with her two imaginary sons. Why the fuck does it have to be those two? Those two kids are one of the worst child actors that I have seen. Even America Chavez was more likeable than those two. That cringy ice cream song they both sang to Wanda made me want to strangle them. Also, if she wanted kids so bad, why not get a man (superhuman or mutant preferred) to fuck her and pump them out? Or does she have a wilted womb like Black Widow?  


\-This (I think) is the first horror-like MCU movie that we've seen. It wanted to try to go for a sort of jump scare factor but to a much lighter degree but had the elements of horror to it in certain circumstances.  


ie: Wanda possessed chasing Strange, Chavez, and Christine Palmer through the tunnels where she stops destroying one of the last doors. The three turn around stupidly (instead of keep on running) to wonder why she didn't destroy the door only for her to appear before them from the other out of nowhere.  


\-Two moms for America Chavez were the only LGBT reference. She got scared by a bee and teleported them away including herself to other universes and are assumed dead. We'll never know of their true fates.  


\-No Tom Cruise - Superior Iron Man sadly, a shame.  


\-Dreamwalking is one of the powers that the Darkhold provides to allow possession of other versions of yourself from the multiverse.  


\-Illuminati looked powerful on paper but super weak against the Scarlet Witch. It is the first time I think that we've seen super heroes being brutally torn up like that on the big screen. I mean you got Black Bolt's mouth sealed then his skull crushed, Captain America (What If... version) sliced in half by the waistline with her own bloody shield, Captain Marvel crushed by her own statue (which is strange to die from considering her cosmic power level), Professor (X)avier getting his neck snapped (which is also strange considering his telekinesis power level), and Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards) with genius-level intellect getting turned into shredded paper. We didn't even get to see Fantastic use any of his powers to any extent. Sorcerer Supreme Baron Mardo on the other hand was busy with our universe Strange.  


\-Eye of Agamotto on Strange's forehead near the end of the movie and Mid-Credit along with Charlize Theron (Clea). The third eye gives Strange a sort of magically enhanced sight. It’s a revealer of truth that can reenact recent events and see into the souls of others. Most likely awakened by the use of the Darkhold.  


\-I liked the musical note mystic arts fight with Sinister Strange in the universe corrupted by the Darkhold. They were really throwing the Mozart out there.  


\-All this talk of the Book of the Vishanti and we never ever get to see it used, ONCE! They really need some magic to protect books containing supremely powerful magic from just getting... BURNED! For christ sakes.

\-Clea - Eventual Sorcerer Supreme of the Dark Dimension. A cousin of Dormammu, the one that Strange tortured when he was trapped in the Dark Dimension to let him escape. She's basically a demi-god (half-mortal, half-pure magical being).

It is my assumption the next Strange movie will involve Dormammu invading Earth, Clea helping Strange which would get her imprisoned by Dormammu, puppet Baron Mardo being the arch nemesis of Strange before being joined by Dormammu with the eventual win for Strange on that movie if they go by the comics. It may even be the first time they'll show a Cosmic entity like Eternity (more powerful than the Celestials that created the Eternals) to deal with Dormammu.  


Eventually the only safe place for Clea would be Earth where she'll lose her magic then study in the Sanctum Sanctorum to find a way to regain them. Strange will later become Sorcerer Supreme and take her on as a disciple where they'll grow close and later she'll become Clea Strange (fuck Christine Palmer). She is one loyal woman I can tell you that. Basically a keeper of hotness (rare these days).  


\-The Necronomicon from the Evil Dead is more or less like the Darkhold hence why we see a cameo by Bruce Campbell, the hotdog or meatball stand owner that Strange used mystic arts on to have him keep hitting himself in the face until Post Credit.  


\-Hope they didn't officially kill Wanda off. I mean she's gone through a lot of trauma and all that but she is still one of the most powerful Marvel characters out there with more emotion than Captain Marvel herself. Sure she fucked up twice but she eventually found herself again in the end and burned all the Darkhold's throughout the multiverse (not sure how she managed that). She didn't need to crush herself in the Darkhold Castle.",Marvel
