1518,"My redesign of the Star Saphire's Emblem and Emotional Entity So in my previous post, I mentioned how I was trying to redesign the star sapphire's because of how dumb the emotional entity is and also how out of place the symbol is. So eventually I came to the conclusion of making the new version a plant. My reason is, A, it's the only life form not used in the other designs of the emotional entities, and B, still works when implamenting both the caring side and parasitic side of love. So anyway below is the redesign of the symbol, it represents the emotional entity of The Caretaker, a large planet-spanning plant being. Just like the original Star Sapphires (btw there just called the violet lanterns now for obvious reasons) it recruits members with a great deal of love and makes them become obsessive with that love and imprison that thing to maintain it. However there are a few key differences, first, they imprison the things they love in sap not crystals, second, it's no longer just romantic love it can be any love as long as it can be sealed (like it can't be love for violence unless I can work that in somehow) even entire nations! Because of the third reason, once the item or person is sealed in the sap it's taken back to the homeworld where the Caretaker resides and placed in its forest to be kept intact as long as the lantern helps in also maintaining the Caretaker's forest. Also, no more men aren't included in the corps bs, men aren't exclusive to rage and violence and women aren't exclusive to love. Anyway, that's my redesign of the Violet Lantern corps please let me know what you think and if I should change anything. P.s. if you say to change the color, I will inform you it is violet according to the colors on the program I made it with.

1386,"Do people actually live on Apokolips? or is it just slaves and Parademons? One thing that's always confused me about Apokolips is it just looks like a giant red rock with a bunch of firey pits and Darkseids layer being like the only building.

Like are there housing and apartments? Is there a civilization, tows, city, country sides? Like wtf even goes down on Apokolips?? 

If Darkseid has all these slaves in his control, wtf do they even do if they're is nothing going on?? Like are they mining mineral's? Are they his house cleaners or are they building stuff?? But from what I see they're are no buildings!!! 

It's confusing because Darkseid makes himself out to be this super powerful guy who should be feared but it looks like his planet hasn't evolved past the stone age. It's so plain, so bare bones!!! At least New Genesis is thriving. They evolved so well!! They got beautiful cloud city's and a safe civilization for all, they are thousands of years ahead in technology and clearly give a shit about keeping there planet in good condition. New Genesis actually gives a shit!!

It seems to me like Darkseid is just a lazy, unmotivated, jealous fedora tippin' man who's having a rage fit all the time. I mean no wonder he's always at war with New Genesis or Earth, he's probably jealous af!! These planets have achieved what Darkseid could never as a ruler. 

I mean please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, I'd love to know if Apokolips is actually a thriving planet growing and evolving, I'd love to hear some Apokolips history and lore. To me it just seems like a bunch of nothingness, so maybe they just never show it??

And OH MY GOD !? 

I've read about 20 chapters till now (started last night lol) and I love it to bits. It's SO CUTE and it's all the content I've wanted from the batfam. The characters are actually pretty well and coherently written and treated with respect. The writers definitely did their research so it doesn't feel out of touch with the canon. There's growth and character development which is so refreshing to see. 

I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea and I respect that; personally I love that they're showing the family as flawed humans who are trying to be better and for me that's what good characters have always been about. (Instead of being rebooted to the same arc over and over again because edge lords on the internet think heroes should also be sad and brooding fighting machines)

I don't even care if it's just fanfiction this is MY canon. I love it SO SO MUCH AHHH I actually tear up when I read it because well ITS REALLY CUTE
