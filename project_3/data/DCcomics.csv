1657918759,godzillavkk,What is your favorite and least favorite adaptational origin change?,"Every superhero adaptation takes liberties, and origins are a common thing to change for better or worse. On this thread, list what adaptational origin you liked best, and which one you hated most of all. And why one worked and why the other did not.

Both of mine involved then hero's parent not being whom they thought they were. 

Best: Batman the Telltale Game. In this episodic game retelling of  Batman's early career, Bruce Wayne learns a horrifying secret about his family. Thomas and Martha Wayne, had ties to the mob and worked with Carmine Falcone and Hamilton Hill. Wayne Enterprises was also a greedy  and amoral corporation that did all the terrible things that real world  corporations do to people and the planet. One day however, Thomas went too far and Martha(who had at least a little bit more standards)  threatened to leave him and take Bruce with her. Thomas soon began to  start thinking about leaving crime behind. But when Mayor Hill found out  about this, he feared Thomas would become a security risk, and hired a  thug named Joe Chill to murder him.

There are a number of reasons why this works for me. The first is because this change allows Batman to keep going strong in the changing world today, as our views of the rich are not as glamorous as they used to be. This also shows how Bruce was never corrupted by the power and wealth he was born into. This also serves as a catalyst of why he is Batman. Because some of the members of his rogues gallery in this continuity, became villains because of Thomas Wayne. So Bruce sees being Batman as correcting his fathers crimes. And finally, this solves a minor issue I have with Batman's origin. Thomas and Martha Wayne were two of the most respected and loved citizens of Gotham. If they were killed in a mugging, it would be all over the news and the murderer would have nowhere to run. But if Chill was a paid hitman who had friends in the Mob, they could protect him when the cops would come looking for him. And it shows gamers and audiences what kind of corruption plagues the world of the elite.

Now for my most hated origin change. Shazam 2019. I once never thought one slip-up could ruin a whole movie. This movie proved me wrong. When Billy Batson finally meets his biological mother, he finds out that she abandoned him due to being unwilling to care for him, and as punishment, she now lives in a poor apartment, with a minimum wage job, and abusive boyfriend. She also reveals that she was kicked out of home due to a teen pregnancy and her boyfriend was incarcerated. She also shows no love for the boy. The whole reason this scene exists, is so that Billy will accept his adoptive family as his real one. And they did a terrible job of doing it.

Why this does not work? Where to begin? I know what she did was wrong, but what Billy doesn't get, and what the movie does not show, was that both he and his mother were screwed over by the system that the Telltale Thomas Wayne ran. Homelessness is caused by things like poverty, long term unemployment, desperation, bias against the homeless, and even disasters, all of which are caused by capitalism. I don't think she would have abandoned him had she not been screwed over. There's a much greater evil at work in that scene, but the movie and Billy refused to show or see it, and the narrative does something that capitalism does, blame poverty, hardship, and misery on the poor and downtrodden. I would have expected a poor orphan like Billy Batson to know what it's like to live under an unfair system that can make people desperate enough to do terrible things, given that he's supposed to be even kinder then Superman. While I initially applauded the movie for it's themes of there is no such thing as pure of heart, maybe it needed Billy to be pure of heart. And it served no purpose apart from appreciating his adopted family. There are much better ways to show it, but that's all it does. It doesn't serve as a catalyst him to be a better hero, and it shifts the blame from a fixed system to a victim of it. And by doing that, it does the audience no favors. Not to mention that with Roe V Wade overturned, this hurts a lot more.

1657905921,Roger_Sceadu,"""All comics are political."""," I find that sentiment ""all comics are political"" a lil' odd, if you don't mind me giving my personal opinion. Whenever I read comics, like the Injustice series as one example, I never really thought there was any politics in it. In fact, I detected more philosophical themes than anything political, particularly on the moral philosophy of batman's deontological ethics and Superman's unfortunate utilitarianism. The interesting part, of course, is that these philosophical themes didn't try to present themselves as the main point either, because the comics managed to include relatable, real-life-like drama of what and how it would seem to be a superhero with those stakes on the line.

Either it's mainly an American thing where you guys consider ""politics"" to be somewhat similar to philosophy or any general aphorisms in life, or there isn't actually politics in the comics I read.",DCcomics

1657878124,Wonderful_Chain_9680,Green Lantern Beware my Power. Spoilers ahead Maybe,"The movie was okay, it’s carried a lot by its animation. Like of all the new DCAMU movies this one has the best fight scenes, in my opinion. I loved the reference to the JLU universe by the inclusion of both Shayera and Mari. Green arrow also seems to be the best part of the movie. The inclusion of Adam Strange was interesting and I’m going to go read Strange Adventures, as he never really had an impact on Young Justice. But that’s pretty much where my praises end. 

How much you enjoy this movie is based on whichever Green Lantern you grew up with that is to say, I grew up with John so my feelings about the movie are much on a lighter side. Also your comic book knowledge also applies to whether or not you will enjoy this movie.

The voice acting especially on the part of Aldis as John is rather stiff, like in some parts it felt like they were righting John Stewart to be slow.  Khary Payton or even Brandon Michael Hall from the Injustice games would have been a better pick in my opinion. Also as much as I love Nolan North his voice ≠ Hal Jordan ,or I’m too used to him as the Ghost from Destiny or Superboy from Young Justice-so really that could be a me issue and shouldn’t be taken to heart in the review, he also has the best performance in the movie 

Others who watched the movie complained about boring sound effects but really that didn’t bother me. But it’s the impact of some scenes that are kinda stiff, for example there’s a Kamikaze scene in the movie, that just happens like I’m sitting there shocked while for the characters it just happens, also they don’t even try to stop they just watch it happen. All so it gets boring in some parts

But all in all okay movie.

Ps: Back to what I said about whichever Lantern you grew up with matters to how you enjoy the movie there’s a scene where, if you’re a fan of Hal, I warn tk go in with an open mind",DCcomics

1657851393,Wonderful_Chain_9680,What are some ways you think DC can make a comeback,"My suggestions and opinions you can disagree or add on no hate:

1. Better use of their animation team, Kingdom Come, Injustice, more recent Dark Knights of steel all of these limited series could be made into multiple season tv shows or movies. DC has ties with studio mir (Studio behind You g Justice and the legend of Korra and OLM (Behind Pokémon) utilizing them properly could lead to bigger revenue, Imagine a 5 season Injustice Animated venture, animated with fight choreography on par with the legend of Korra or even by Mappa that would be amazing, especially with the popularity of evil Superman ( I also don’t like this trope however think with your wallets that’s what’s popular right now)

2. Much more cohesive and permanent storytelling, the reason why manga is at the top is because of the writing and investment, when I invest time into One Punch Man for example I get my payoff once a decision has been made it’s over it’s done no take backs. One thing about comic books is nothing matters, Joker war I was expecting something more I thought they were gonna keep the joker out permanently, nope he got away.

3. Cinematic Universe: DCs movies post Josstice League have been really good, in general Peacemaker is better than most of the MCU shows, but they jumped the gun in their execution. Water Hamada is good, but taking full advantage of HBO Max would be perfect the way the movies are spaced perfect they just need to keep up their quality aspect of their movies, this would be perfect.

4. Better digital availability, comixology sucks to the point in just forego buying comic books in general. Marvel has the marvel app and I have to go all the way to Sauga, to buy comics here in Ontario and they didn’t even have the latest issues 

5. Put the spotlight, on your c-D list characters I love Batman, but give other characters the spotlight, Aquaman is the highest grossing DC Movie, not the Batman, not man of steel, not Joker. Aquaman, do more Im hyped for Black Adam, cus I know it’s gonna be good.

&amp;#x200B;

Birds of Prey 2

In this movie the exact same team is here. (and Harley Quinn) The main villain is Copperhead (the big buff man one) And it has Cassandra Cain become Batgirl.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Arrow 2

It would be a good movie okk

&amp;#x200B;

Shazam 4

Idk sorryyyyyyy

&amp;#x200B;

Booster Gold 2

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

Blue beetle 2

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 

The Members of the J.S.A would be Jay Garrick's Flash, Alan Scotts Green Lantern, Atom Smasher, Powergirl, Hour Man, Doctor Fate and the Spectre. It would hint at a crisis on infinite earth's movie.

&amp;#x200B;

The Green Lanterns

This movie would have Hal Jordan being retired and Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner all being green lanterns. The Story will be darkest night/ brightest day. The Villain will resurrect Deathstroke, The Flash, Copperhead and a bunch of others. (the flash and batman are resurrected from the whole white lantern thing, but no other heroes were resurrected) (Simon Was recruited to help fight Nekron, and Jessica had her backstory inbetween movies.)

&amp;#x200B;

Booster Gold 2

Sorrryryryry

&amp;#x200B;

Doom Patrol 2

Sorry

&amp;#x200B;

The Flash 4

A Bart Allen story and has flash not do much flash stuff anymore. (kinda like retiring but not really) Idk much for the villain or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Teen Titans 2

This Movie Would have Bart Allen's kid flash and Terra Join the teen titans. For the story……….. ……..sorry idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman &amp; Superboy 

Will be the origin for Superboy. Idk anything for the villains and all that. (it will have a damian wayne after credit scene)

&amp;#x200B;

The Dark Knights Return

After Batman Is Resurrected, Him And CATWOMAN have Damian Wayne. For the villain maybe Dr. Freeze, poison ivy, and some other villains doing something evil. (i couldn’t think of anything else)

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 2

This movie will have Stargirl, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Cyclone, Doctor Mid-Nite and Sandman join the J.S.A. The Villain could be some weird earth 2 legion of doom.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 

This movie is also on earth 2. This Movie would be about Him and Powergirl fighting brutaal. But for the finer details of the plot, sorry iddkdkdkdkdkdk.

&amp;#x200B;

The New Teen Titans

After a while, The Teen Titans split. Now Damian Started a new version with Superboy, And Bart Allen. (Superboy and Damian don’t like each other very much but everybody likes Bart) I know I've said it a million times but, for the plot, IDKKKK.

&amp;#x200B;

Arsenal (Tv Show)

This Would be a show about green arrow training arsenal to be his successor. And black canary is in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths part 1

I'll just put everything on part 2 

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths part 2

Since I haven’t read many comics, I don’t know this story. But I do know the general idea. You Know, alternate earth characters come to Earth one/prime/whatever, the anti-monitor is the villain, blah blah blah. For Deaths though, Guy Gardner, Green Arrow, and Supergirl are the main ones. From Earth two, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Sandman die.

&amp;#x200B;

Booster gold 3

I'm so sorry, iddk.

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 

Apologies 

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder Girl

:/

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Beetle 3

:///////

&amp;#x200B;

Cyborg

Since the old teen titans Split, Beast-Boy and Cyborg are just kinda there. Another filler movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lanterns: The Far Sector

A Sojourner Mullein movie, and also Teen Lantern. In this movie they both just kinda do whatever. There is a part about the Orange Lanterns, and other one off sh!t.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League 8 (Young Justice or Legion of Super-Heroes)

Superman (superboy) Damian Wayne as Batman, Aqualad, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash (Bart), Nightwing, Cassandra Cain’s Batgirl, Raven, Cyborg, Beast-Boy, Blue-Beetle, Arsenal, Teen Lantern, Terra, Stargirl and Shazam are apart of the new Justice League. The Main Villains are the crime syndicate who came to earth prime during Crisis on Infinite earths. (most of the former justice league villains and earth 2 j.s.a characters are in this too but not the focus.

&amp;#x200B;

Explaining Some Stuff

Now Superman (Clark Kent) Isn’t really doing hero stuff anymore, The same goes for Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, and a couple of other characters. (If they don’t appear prominently in the new movies just assume that's what happened.) And Val-Zod is now being superman along with Jon Kent and Power-Girl. (kinda) And for Batman characters, Bruce isn’t doing Batman, Dick Grayson is Nightwing, Tim Drake is Batman and Damian is a young Batman (like 15-16 years old), Barbara Gordon isn’t being Batgirl anymore, and Cassandra Cain is.

&amp;#x200B;

Birds Of Prey 3

The Joker Is still doing stupid shit. And Pisses off the birds of prey. And blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, Joker ends up falling off a building and dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 2

Idk about this movie sorrryryryryryryryryyryryryry. (Red Tornado is in it tho so that's cool.)

&amp;#x200B;

The New Gods

://///////////////////////////////////////////////

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 2

The villain is somebody, maybe siren idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Elseworld (Tv Show)

This is a live action show about Elseworld comics (obviously). Kind of like the “What If?” show but live action.

Episodes:

1. Batman: Gotham by Gaslight

2. Superman: Red Son

3. Justice League: The Nail

4. Kingdom Come

5. Dceased

6. Batman: In Darkest Night

7. All-Star Superman

8. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 1

9. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 2

&amp;#x200B;

The New Superman

Jon Kent is superman. The villain can be Amazo (It should be Kid Amazo but I haven’t done the first Amazo yet so idk.)

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder-Girl: Power of the Gods

(Donna Troy was Wonder-Girl in both of the movies btw.)

This movie is really good. The story would be about Wonder-Girl and Wonder-Woman fighting the Greek gods for some reason and Diana learning about her being a god sorta and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I’ll Keep going idk.

Thank you for reading all this garbage!!! (:

Set after the controversial events of Infinite Crisis, Checkmate picks up right after Maxwell Lord’s death and the disbandment of the titular organization. When the group’s purpose and necessity are called into question, the United Nations reworks the team’s structure to demonstrate the capabilities of such an operation. Using the ""Rule of Two"",  the team is divided into sets of joint partnerships between human and metahuman leaders. With members such as Sasha Bordeaux, Mister Terrific, Fire, and Alan Scott, Checkmate acts as intelligence intervention tasked with establishing and maintaining order.

It reminded me of a song Pete Seeger wrote that went “I learned that murderers die for the crime / even if we make a mistake sometimes” so it seems like the death penalty was hotly debated at the time.

I already own Final Crisis. I would be able to get pretty much all of the TPBs covered in the first 2 omnis for the price of the first.

My question is do the omnibuses cover anything that the TPBs don't that would make it the preferred format (besides the usual of hardcover, oversized art, etc.) and does that added content enrich the overall run significantly?

1657721841,MagisterPraeceptorum,What Fans Get Wrong About the Justice League and Legacy Heroes,"I’ve seen a number of fans on here who want to see the Justice League line-up changed in a more permanent fashion, especially with retiring the old heroes and having them succeeded by legacy characters. Or alternatively, some fans perhaps don’t feel the need to have younger heroes succeed to any mantles, but instead just want characters like the Titans to helm the League as their own identities. Dark Crisis is definitely exploring these ideas in some interesting ways, even if it’s clear the status quo will reset after the event is over. 

In my opinion however, this mentality reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. What truly makes the Justice League the Justice League isn’t the name. It’s the Magnificent Seven, and especially the Trinity. Any version of the JL that doesn’t include Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Diana Prince will always be lesser. In addition to being around for 80+ years, the Trinity are, alongside Spider-man, the most iconic, beloved, and celebrated superheroes across the entire world.",DCcomics

The story involved Bruce Wayne training (with the League of Assassins?) in which he refused to kill any of the men he was fighting. He fought until the men decided to stop fighting him, due to his indominable spirit.

Since the merger and DC listening to the Twitter People, they replaced Barry with Wally and immidately stopped reading every single DC Book, and I really miss it. 

I know there this Dark Crisis ongoing, so at the end of that is Barry going to return as the Main Flash in The Flash book?

Obviously DC made a mistake, trying to get the Twitter people to buy The Flash thinking that all the Barry Allen fans they made would stick around and the people who like Wally would buy it, which obviously didn't happen.

Anyway, basically the Title. Does anyone know if Barry Allen is returning as the Main Flash anytime soon?",DCcomics

1657667655,Some-Dog9800,I'm working on a fanfic project with my brother. Can y'all help us decide on a villain?,"The story is divided into several ongoing arcs which build up to a massive Endgame-level finale. One story arc is designated for each corner of the DC universe, nonpowered street-level heroes, more cosmic superheroes, mainly the Green Lanterns, and the mystical side with heroes like Zatanna and Dr. Fate. The nonpowered heroes primarily face the the League of Assassins and the splinter factions which developed following the death of Ra's Al Ghul as they engage in their Shadow War. Talia Al Ghul is the main villain of this arc, and the finale has heroes like Batman and Green Arrow going up against Leviathan. The cosmic superheroes like the Green Lanterns mostly tie into the Darkest Hour, the eventual crisis event of this timeline in which a threat will rise from Earth-4 (the fourth world of the 52), enabled by the weakening of the walls separating each universe due to the death of one of Earth's Ten Paragons. But I'm struggling to come up with a threat for the mystical heroes to combat. I've narrowed it down to either the Queen of Fables, Eclipso, Hecate, or Morgan le Fay. I'm leaning more towards Hecate or Morgan because they could both be set up in prior entries with appearances from Circe and Etrigan respectively. But I wanted some outside opinions. Is there anyone else I could use that isn't listed?

1657556587,ImaFireSquid,Some deconstructions of DC comics rated based on if they had anything interesting to say,"There are so many. It's almost always superman or the Justice League, but I've read and watched quite a few, so here are some of the more popular ones.

This is my opinion. This is not objective truth. Art doesn't have objective truth. Some people pay millions for a green block. Others pay pennies for intricate Chinese woven paintings. The world is weird.

**Harley Quinn- 9/10**

What if Harley had complex emotions and we dredged up a bunch of random underused supervillains and made them tremendously dysfunctional? I dig it. It doesn't immediately go ""DC but dark"", it goes ""DC but chaotic"" and I respect that. The actual moral seems to be about gaining a sense of self-worth, which isn't a bad way to go at all.

**The Watchmen- 8/10**

The moral seems to be ""when you get too big and powerful, you lose track of the most important parts of life."" Remakes don't always focus on that as much though, and instead focus on how cool Rorsach is. And to be fair, Rorsach is very cool. It's been added into DC comics now so it's not even a DC parody anymore. It's just a DC thing.

**The Boys- 8/10**

Seems to be a statement about corporations dehumanizing individuals for a profit. Good characters, and the show has a very different trajectory than the comics but neither sucks. Solid Justice League parody. The characters are aesthetically the justice league, and when you first see them they look like the justice league, but as the story progresses they veer so far off that it becomes a totally different work.

**Invincible- 5/10**

What if Superman was evil aaaand killed the Justice League? The concept isn't mind blowing, but evil Superman training his son is a decent premise for a story about lots of gore and angst.

**Man of Steel- 4/10**

""What if Superman had to kill somebody?"" asks the guy who forgot what Superman's whole deal was. We jumped into a theoretical ""Superman's darkest hour"" while neither developing the character nor dealing with the consequences of that choice. Decent opening act though.

**Brightburn- 2/10**

What if Superman was evil? Wouldn't that be bad? Yes it would. Literally nobody is questioning whether an evil Superman would be a bad thing. They tried to tease an evil Justice League series too. Very ambitious for a show with the most simple question and answer ever. The eyeball scene was gross.",DCcomics

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

1657485542,Mykk6788,Convince me otherwise: Jason Todd should be the Next Batman,"Before I start, I want to get the big Elephant out of the room asap. I don't have a problem with Jace Fox's Batman, nor do I have a problem with there being a ""Black Batman"". There already were throughout the Multiverse for years. DC has moved Jace to NY so I'm talking about a Batman for Gotham.

Now that that's out of the way, let me explain my reasoning why. First off this is more of a hypothetical. If Bruce didn't return after Dark Crisis, or if Bruce decided his Justice League duties needed to come first, or any other reason for Bruce's absence happened.

Next we list out all the potential folks who have properly earned the right to take up the mantle next and look into each:

- Nightwing (Dick Grayson)

- Red Robin (Tim Drake)

- Robin (Damian Wayne)

- Red Hood (Jason Todd)

Nightwing:
The obvious first choice, as without Bruce being counted, has literally been Batman more than the others. The problem though lies with motivation, character and Legacy. Dick has never been motivated to take over as Batman from Bruce. Halfway through being Robin he knew he didn't want to. His character doesn't fit with Batman either, it's akin to casting a charismatic actor in a role as an unfeeling emotionless character. Nightwings whole thing is cracking jokes and lightening the mood even with bullets flying over his head. Then there's Legacy, the Nightwing hero moniker is one of the rare Legacy characters that folks who aren't hugely familiar with DC have still heard of or know of. He's earned the right to be as known as any DC Character over the years.

Red Robin:
Best Detective of the bunch and a whizz at tech. But Drake has seen what kind of Batman he could become thanks to Jor El. Ever since then he's been adamant to distance himself from becoming Batman as much as possible, even changing his hero name to Drake at one point, which luckily DC had the sense to even mock recently. He just doesn't want it.

Robin:
Damien Wayne started out as an annoying brat everyone wanted to die. But by the time he did die, he was one of the most interesting characters in the Batfamily and everyone wanted him back. I honestly think he'd make a great Batman. In the future. But he's just too young. I think the comics have him at age 14 right now, so he literally couldn't be a Bat-MAN yet.

Red Hood:
The original brat everyone hated and wanted dead. And then they goy to vote on it and he did. But when he returned as Red Hood it not only gave us a great story, but a great new complex character to find out about. Villain to anti-hero to hero back to anti-hero. Jason's been thrown around DC a lot over the years simply because he has no direction. It's because of everything above that I think he'd make a great Batman with some fantastic story ideas. Him and Bruce are at each others throats every weekend yet in an emergency he always shows up, as long as he can.

The way I imagined it is Bruce has left Video Messages for each Batfamily member. Jason's is the last, and although it starts off with Bruce lecturing him about killing and guns, it turns into a challenge. Bruce explains that when Jason returned he told Bruce he could clean up Gotham better than him. Bruce challenges Jason to do this as Batman. ""No guns, no killing, you wanted to prove you could clean up Gotham better, so be better"". ""This is your one and only chance to finally prove you meant what you said, and to harness that darkness I know is inside you, as it was with me, and use it to make every street thug, monster and villain fear the name Batman again"".

Jason would make mistakes. Realise he had a lot of assumptions about being Batman that are being proven incorrect with every single day. Realise that Bruce never truly did this on his own with Alfred and the Robins around and so push himself to ask the Batfamily for help. Most of all he'd struggle with defining ""Justice"", as his previous alterego preferred killing rather than looking to rehabilitate. Theres lots of Batman stories that could be told with Jason under the cowl that just couldn't be told with Bruce. Jason knows living on the streets, he can eventually sympathise and empathise.


Looking for feedback though. Anyone have any reasons why Jason wouldn't fit?",DCcomics

1657468010,Archer_Without_Fear,Action Comics and the Authority,"Action Comics has ben my favorite DC book for a while now, and one thing I love in particular is that PKJ and Morrison gave Superman his own team with the Authority.

I hope they do since they play off Superman well, and I'd like to see some of the less used characters, like Manchester Black, get used more.

This issue would have been released in the late 80s-early 90s, and featured an interview with a guy who had been a henchman for all of the major villains of Batman, so he had a whole closet full of silly outfits - cold weather, cat themed, bird themed, etc. I don’t remember too much else about the story, but I thought that it was penciled by Bernie Mireault, but that turned out to be a Riddler Secret Origin story written by Neil Gaiman.

Was City of Bane well received by fans?  I really didn't enjoy most of it, and kind of wished it ended much sooner than it did.  strange also that it was interrupted so much by flashback comics, secret files, and the dream thing Batman was stuck in.


The whole storyline felt really off to me. I re-read the New 52, then rebirth, then batman rebirth, dark knights metal, etc.  so I dont think I missed much leading up to it tbh.



I missed when it was release.  Anyone who was around then remember how it was received? or your thoughts in general?

1657451246,RhythmicCacophony,What version of the Teen Titans do you think would work best for a cinematic adaptation in a hypothetical rebooted DCEU?,"For me, I think a combination of the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) and the Teen Titans (2003-2011) would be the best choice for the big screen. Why? Well the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) are by far the most iconic and popular version of the team period. A big reason for this being that it introduced unique stories and characters that helped the team differentiate itself from the Justice League (e.g. Trigon, Judas Contract, etcetera). Thereby giving them an identity of their own instead of just having them be watered down versions of their mentors.

But why do I say that the Teen Titans (2003-2011) run should be combined with this? Well for one because I personally think Superboy should also be on the team considering how iconic he is as well as how great his origin story is what with being tied to the death of superman and all that. However, the main reason I think the Teen Titans (2003-2011) should be combined with the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) is because I think Cassie Sandsmark is a more interesting Wonder Girl who can also serve a greater purpose in helping along other hypothetical plotlines within the DCEU. For example, you could have such that after Robin becomes Nightwing he decides to leave the team in order to be with and work alongside Oracle after she was crippled, with Cassie taking leadership of the team in his stead. Something she has proven capable of doing as seen when she took charge of the team after winning the vote against Robin. Furthermore, Cassie also has a much more straightforward continuity and backstory then Donna Troy does. Thus, there would be less convolution there.

Basically my take on it is that I think that the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) is the best version of the team and most obvious choice to get a cinematic adaptation. Just with the minor edit of adding Superboy and replacing Donna Troy with Cassie Sandsmark.

In any case, what do you think? What version of the Teen Titans do you believe would work best for the big screen and why?",DCcomics

1657428305,Dapper-World-4862,Can someone explain the powers of the green lantern ring?,"So I looked at the wiki for the green lantern ring (DC Database), but I still have questions concerning the actual abilities of the ring. Many of these questions sprung from the feats of Hal Jordan, like, the dude made his \*own\* ring? And it made him immortal?? So the wiki listed the powers of the green lantern ring as so: Energy Projection (beams, pew pew), Force Field (not constructs, but the green outline shown on the user's body), Energy Construct Creation, Superhuman Strength, Phasing, Environmental Playback, time travel (wtf? there's no actual way, right?), Energy Twin, Flight and Life Support, Wormholes and Spatial Warps (so if they can teleport, wtf don't they do it more often in shows and comics?),  Resurrection (I remember Hal used this after he purposely killed himself just to show that he could bi-pass the ring's wont-let-you-kill-yourself defense via his will, just to prove a point. So is he immortal?), and Preset Conditions (so I could order the ring to kill the next user after I die????)

1657414722,Paisley_Bear,Question about Batman: Under The Red Hood (Spoilers!),"Okay, so in the end,  Blüdhaven is destroyed by a living bomb and then Bruce, Jason, and then the Joker have that confrontation. Bruce's batarang seemingly kills Jason, and then Joker detonates the explosives with a knife, blowing up the whole building they're in.

So...I'm 99.99% certain they all die, obviously, right? Does *Under The Red Hood* take place on a separate earth from any of the later material featuring Red Hood? Obviously DC universe has multiple earths so it'd make sense, and I know it was trying to explain that after the explosion in the epilogue but I just want to make sure I have it right: Nightwing died in Blüdhaven, right? Then Bruce accidentally killed Jason before Jason could kill the Joker, and then Joker ended up killing both himself and Bruce by setting off the explosives in the building?

1657406649,manofsteel9979,How would you resurrect DC Comics Sales,"The line is a mess. Sales figures are down everywhere outside of anything starring Bruce Wayne. The monthly Top 100 comics include barely little DC titles that don't include Batman.

By the way, the above commentary isn't opinion. I can link to monthly sales numbers and Top 100 selling titles by month. The state of DC Comics right now is horrendous...

What do you do to fix this? What would your relaunch be? How many weeklies and what would they be. Why would you go in this direction?

How would you restore top tier characters like the Superman and Wonder Woman lines?

1657406646,moldychipmunk,"[Discussion] Garfield Logan, the sensitive soul with a big heart","Gar Logan holds a special place in my heart for many reasons. Whether it's his enduring positivity in the face of grief and trauma, childlike joy in using his animal powers, or remaining true to his offbeat self in spite of others telling him to get serious, I've always found the character a source of comfort.

Recently I found [one of the best profiles I've seen of Gar](https://www.cbr.com/teen-titans-beast-boy-gay/), that connects some of these dots, making a case for his continued relevance and future potential. Putting aside the clickbaity title, some thoughtful points are made, and patterns emerge in how he relates to others. The key premise is:

&gt;Beast Boy is an incredibly romantic person at heart, someone who loves to love and yearns to *be* loved...  He's a sensitive soul with love for everyone in his heart.  

The author goes a step further to describe Gar as a queer-coded character. I think this is open to interpretation (I happen to agree). But at the very least, these qualities are rarely represented in male characters in comics, and to me they're quite welcome and important. Notably, the author leaves sexual attraction out of the analysis completely, focusing on the queer aspect of simply being outside the norm in how one approaches romance, platonic friendships, or expressions of love in general.

I think very few recognize this aspect of Gar, certainly not at DC. As long as grim, dark stories sell, his potential will continue to be overlooked. But I think stories with more heart - indeed, where being a cheerful goof is a super-power - would find an audience in these bleak, disconnected times.

As a peculiar sort myself, I always assumed my take on Gar existed only in my own mind, but perhaps others see it too. Anyone feel the same?",DCcomics

1657401816,Dapper-World-4862,Can the Green Lantern Ring *make* someone? A living Human?,"So I'm not very knowledgeable concerning the comics, so if this was clearly answered somewhere out there, sorry for wasting your time.

The green lantern ring can make anything as long as the user can imagine it, and has the willpower to back up the creation and maintenance of it, right? So hypothetically, a very strong user (i.e Hal Jorden who apparently beat the living incarnation of Will that took the form of a whale, wtf?) could create a human if they knew the ins and outs of our biology? Like, if a powerful green lantern could ""imagine"" every human structure, including the structure of a developed brain, could they \*make\* someone? If a world-teir  **Anthropologist** (the study of what makes a human, human) got a ring, could they construct a human with a conscious if they had the will to maintain him/her?

While you're here, I want to ask if the green lantern ring could make gas. Obviously, they can make hard constructions, but they have also been shown to make liquids. So what about gases? 

Also also, there's the idea that the user, depending on his strength of will, can apply these so-called, ""properties"" to their constructs. For example, one user managed to apply the property of Kryptonite to a rock-like construct that actually affected Superman. Uh, wtf? Was that cannon??? What does that mean, though?",DCcomics

1657388856,manofsteel9979,Legacy Characters shouldn't exist,"This is probably a hot take but I'll explain...

The day Bruce Wayne hangs it up, there should never be another Batman. Give the next hero his own identity. The best example of this is Nightwing.

Dick Grayson has spent almost 40 years becoming his own man with his own identity. He doesn't need the Batman name to succeed. This organic character growth should happen to all the other former Robin's. Batman is Batman because of the person underneath. The trauma the personality, the character growth. Jason Todd wearing the Batsuit, is Jason Todd, not Batman.

The same thing with Superboy. Give him his own name and identity separate from Clark. There will never ever be another Superman. Connor and/or Jon should create new identities that showcase who they are as individuals and what makes them heroes without needing to just slap an S on their chest. 

Now when it comes to Green Lanterns this would be my only real separation because the Lantern corps are set up a military organization where the name itself is more a rank than a superhero identity. Lantern of 2481 or Lantern of 7456, etc etc etc...

But instead of trying to shoehorn sidekicks into their mentors, let them instead show why they are individual and unique by giving them their own name independent of the hero they help.

Kind of curious what others think.",DCcomics

1657322895,bahamut_megaflare,[Character of the Month] Mister Terrific,"# [Mister Terrific](https://i.imgur.com/HIH8whR.png)

**Created by:** John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake

**First Appearance:** *The Spectre v3 #54*

**Affiliated Organizations:** Justice Society of America, Justice League of America, Checkmate, The Terrifics

**Friends/Allies:** Alan Scott (Green Lantern), Jay Garrick (Flash), Doctor Mid-Nite, Batman, Black Lightning, Sasha Bordeaux

**Strengths/Abilities:** Genius-level intellect (third smartest man in the world), T-Spheres, martial arts, olympic-level athletics, detective skills

**Overview**

**Origins**

Self proclaimed, “third smartest man in the world”, Michael Holt made his debut in the pages of The Spectre #54. With a natural inclination to learn and an aptitude for retaining extraordinary skills, Holt had already earned 14 Ph.D’s, built a sophisticated tech firm called Cyberware, and was a gold medal Olympic athlete before becoming a superhero. Holt’s heroic journey was triggered by two separate tragedies; the death of his mentally handicaped brother and the accidental death of his pregnant wife in a fatal car crash. 

Being overwhelmed with grief and maintaining a bleak outlook on life, Holt attempted to take his life, but was stopped by the Spirit of God’s Vengeance. The Spectre then showed Michael the life of Terry Sloane, otherwise known as the Golden Age hero, Mister Terrific. Inspired by Sloane’s life, Michael adopted a costume with “fair play” across the sleeves and joined the Justice Society of America as the new Mister Terrific.

**Justice Society of America**

Sometime before joining the JSA, Holt retired from the corporate world and took on a role within the company, TylerCo. In exchange for the company funding a youth center that the hero founded, he would have to become a security consultant for them in matters of industrial espionage. This is where Holt first encountered Sandy Hawkins, the JSA member known as Sand. Hawkins had lost control of his powers and became a being composed of sentient sand. TylerCo was searching for a cure for his condition and the meeting between the two heroes left Sand impressed, which prompted him to extend JSA membership to Michael.


Mister Terrific met the other team members at their headquarters and his first mission was joining an ongoing battle with Kobra. At this time, the team was faced with two exponential threats; the Kobra cult and the time-warping villain known as Extant. To deal with both enemies simultaneously, the Justice Society was divided into two teams with Mister Terrific being selected to take on the snake zealots. Holt and his half of the JSA infiltrated Blackhawk Island to rescue the captured hero Airwave, whose powers were being exploited to hijack all technology on the planet. The success of the mission led Mister Terrific to stay and embark on more operations with the team. 

When Hawkman was eventually resurrected and returned to the team, there was a new bid for leadership of the JSA. Sand was acting chairman at the time, but an aggressive Hawkman pleaded for the position. After a disagreement between the two, leadership of the Justice Society was put to a vote with Michael Holt being chosen as the new leader. As acting chairman, Holt embarked on various team adventures including an off-world battle on Thanagar, engaging in games of life or death at the hands of Roulette, time travel hijinks with Holt meeting Terry Sloan, an intense battle between fellow JSA members and Black Adam, a spiritual meeting between his deceased wife, and many more.

**Infinite Crisis / One Year Later / Checkmate / Final Crisis**

Batman’s organic and self replicating surveillance satellite system known as Brother Eye, was hijacked by Checkmate’s Black King, Maxwell Lord. Lord corrupted the artificial intelligence and began building an army of sleeper agents embedded with Brother Eye’s nano-infused technology. Known as OMACs, these agents were tasked with hunting and exterminating super powered individuals. 

As Infinite Crisis progressed, civilians were caught in the OMAC crossfire and began turning as well. Mister Terrific was selected by Batman for a team assembled for an attack on Brother Eye, as the satellite was responsible for controlling the OMACs. Holt’s role in the assault was critical as his invisibility to all technology allowed him to reach the satellite's propulsion system. From there he was able to destroy it and send it on a downward trajectory crashing down to Earth.

After the Crisis, Holt joined the reformed Checkmate as the White King's Bishop. Alan Scott was acting White King and personally selected Terrific for the recently implemented, “rule of two”. During this time, Holt was also engaged in a relationship with fellow Checkmate agent Sasha Bordeaux, who was the Black Queen. After their first mission, Scott would pass his position as White King to Terrific after he was removed from the organization for choosing not to publicly shame China by revealing they were involved with the Kobra cult. This forces Holt to relinquish his JSA chairman position.

During Final Crisis, a team consisting of Mister Terrific, Cheetah, Snapper Carr, and Sasha Bordeaux were trapped within the ruins of Checkmate headquarters. Bordeaux was utilizing her OMAC programming to temporarily shut down her bodily functions to avoid turning into a brainwashed Justifier. The team was overwhelmed and unable to rally past the Anti-Life manipulated metahumans. Before falling prey to the same fate as the former heroes hunting them, Terrific activated a new OMAC population that was programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, with the hopes they could protect the last few humans against the Justifiers.

1657316758,Raanor,Looking for a good DC comics podcasts that explains the universe,"Hi everybody. So I‘ve recently decided to jump into DC after mainly reading Marvel for the last couple of years. I‘m also someone that spends quite a lot of time listening to podcasts. One I‘m especially fond of is Marveling at Marvels marvels. For those that don‘t know the show: an experienced comic reader picks each episode a marvel character and explains their history to someone who has never touched a comic book. It helped me very much in better understanding the universe as it was quite overwhelming when I started reading. Now that I want to start with Dc, again I have the feeling there is a lot of background that I miss and a similar podcast could help me fill the gaps. I know the most important characters and events (I think), but it’d be great to get the bigger picture. I‘ve been searching around, but the only shows I found were either not about the comics at all or more about the latest news. If someone of you knows a good show that is about explaining the universe and its history I‘d be very grateful.",DCcomics

B) multiple creators have revealed many things such as Superman was going to be more authoritarian which was changed in Grant Morisson's Superman and the authority, John riddley was gonna replace James Tynion as Batman writer after issue 100, and it was gonna change to 5G with Jace Fox as Batman.

C) this timeline was meant to age with real time, example: Superman and Batman would have started in the 50s/60s and would be in there 50s now which would mean they would be replaced and wonder woman would have started in World War II

This Timeline was scrapped once Didio was fired and the ideas were incorporated into infinite Frontier &amp; Future state

So yea thank you for reading this, just go crazy in the comments with what you know about 5G",DCcomics
1657296049,Aster1997,Visual Identity for DC characters (ex. Dick Grayson Romani representation),"TL;DR - How much can you change about a character before they are not that character anymore. Is their entire physical appearance up for grabs as long as their story and actions are not altered?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all, I have been seeing a lot of passionate discussion about ""valid"" representation of characters (in particular Dick Grayson) in regards to their cultural heritage vs. canonical/traditional depiction.

I was curious to gather some wider opinions on the matter, rather than just the ones I've been seeing in the last three posts regarding  Gabriel Larragán's artwork.

Mainly, how important is a character's visual identity compared to their identity as a whole.  
I think the discussion in those aforementioned threads was becoming very racial in nature.  


So I wanted to point some things out and find out how others feel.  
I think in comic books especially the superhero persona gives a lot of freedom in terms of the expression of the pedestrian alter-ego. For example, while Bruce Wayne is usually depicted as tall and  muscular, there is a variety in his actual build over time. You have Frank Miller and Ben Affleck portrayals where Bruce is very built, and you have Christian Bale and David Mazzucchelli depictions where he has a leaner build. So at what point do we stop recognizing the character as Bruce Wayne?  


A lot of people are saying that you can't change Dick Grayson from white or white passing to more visually representative of a Romani (an Indo-Aryan Ethnicity with Asian roots) heritage. If you take that stance, then why doesn't it apply to other physical traits? The differences in build I listed above. Or let's go further, is hair color an acceptable change? Is hair color a bigger part of identity than build? Often artists depictions of ""dark hair"" characters will range from brown to black. Is Ezra Miller's Flash as objectionable as a darker complexion Dick Grayson. Shouldn't actors dye their hair or wear wigs to better match the source material? Going back to ethnicity, Cass Cain is canonically biracial. I recognize that's different than being 1/4th romani when 100% romani people can also just be white passing. I also recognize that is significantly more nuanced than simple skin tone, but I would say her artistic depictions have a pretty wide range from very asian to very white. 

I think basically the point I'm trying to make is that it's easy to say a character can be depicted any way you want OR a character has to be depicted as they are traditionally within the cannon. At the same time if it is just a matter of wanting better representation, isn't it not more preferable to create brand new characters?",DCcomics
1657289382,Kafadanapa,"DC's Thematic Version of Spiderman, and it's Rip Off Version?","It's no secret Marvel and DC have spent decades stealing ideas from each other. So I feel as though DC has a legally distinct Version of Spiderman. All I can think of is that one black costumed spiderman wannabe that Artemis captured in Young Justice.

Now the thematic version of spiderman is tricky &amp; I can see multiple characters pulling this off since it's more of a trope to be ""'The young 'adorkable' dumbass whose potential will eventually match if not exceed the capabilities of the current Heroes.""

3- doosmday clock was a great comic

4-nightwing is overrated......the character works better as leader of the titans or any groups than in solo runs

5- i actually like the superman/WW couple but i sick of the superman/lois soulmate status quo who bored me to death

6- if raz al ghul, bane or the riddle had the same media and comic exposure that joker have...people would realize that they are better villains than the joker

7- someone said this in another post and i quite agree with him/her....the best gesture of peace Wonder woman  could do would be actually integrate more men in themyscira instead of choosing isolationism

I wish that they make individual movies of characters in the ""Pattinson-Verse"" (like how the CW is the Arrow-Verse), in a timeline like: 

- The Batman

- Green Arrow: With Stephen Amell coz he deserves more love

- Superman: Red White and Blue Son (for confussion's sake)

- Wonder Woman: The Return of Gal Gadot

- The Batman 2: With Brayn Cranston as Mr. Freeze and Aaron Paul as Mrs. Freeze

- Green Lantern: The Return of Ryan Reynolds from Harold and Kumar

- The Flash: With Grant Gustin coz fuck Ezra Miller

- The Justice League: introduce Cyborg in a Teen Titans movie coz hes more Titan than Leaguer for me

A big Avengers level threat needs build up, and I think putting out movie after movie based on individual characters is a great way to create a universe. I could see them adapting the first season of Arrow into a Green Arrow movie, and Wonder Woman should continue to be played by Gal Gadot coz I love her.

I also really wanna see an adaptation of Justice League: Doom so Robert Pattinson can say ""Then you're all damn fools"" to the JL members at the end of the movie.",DCcomics

I really enjoyed Animal Man, and when I read it (a long time ago) I also read Justice League International, and really enjoyed that. I'm now reading the 1986 Len Wein run of Blue Beetle and enjoying that, and was hoping people could direct me towards other comics that felt like Animal Man / Blue Beetle / JLI? They're all from around the late 80s and have a bit of a comedic tone I guess, but it's a particular tone I don't really feel I've come across outside of this era of DC comics.

Is The New 52 still canon? If so, what were the best runs? I did order volume 1 of Batgirl's run, but I wanna know if anything else is worth it.

1656999186,RhythmicCacophony,What if all the Robins were a single person who had a huge character arc,"This is just a thought that I had, but I always found it weird that Batman had multiple Robins. Which is to say that multiple different people took on the vigilante persona of Robin. Starting with Dick Grayson who was then replaced by Jason Todd who was then replaced by Tim Drake who was then replaced by Damian Wayne.

While I know the meta reason this happened was to keep the dynamic Robin had with Batman fresh and interesting as well as give room for various Robins to grow out of the role and into their own people, it still just never sat right with me. I almost saw it as Batman essentially ""shopping"" for a new Robin once his old one had moved on. Which just seems wrong. While I know that's a bit of an oversimplification that doesn't do the context of each new Robin recruitment justice, it's still how I feel.

Thus, I was wondering what other people think about the idea of all the various Robins (Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian) being one character. While that might sound a little unclear, here's sort of what I had in mind:

...

This single unified Robin would be the assassin son of Batman and Talia al Ghul and would slowly gain humanity via becoming Robin, a vigilante sidekick to his father. Later deciding in spite of this that the Joker was too evil for any kind of mercy unlike the rest of the rogues and thus attempting to put him down for good, only to fail and get beaten to death. Later being revived by a Lazarus Pit due to being the grandson of Ra's al Ghul. Becoming mentally disturbed and returning to Gotham in order to kill all the criminals including the Joker. Being stopped by his father who would help him move past his trauma. In the aftermath deciding to leave Gotham behind in favor of finding a new purpose in his life due to all he had been through. Eventually teaming up with other young vigilante sidekicks and deciding to create a superhero team with them known as the Titans. As he spent time with them his broken soul would mend back together (figuratively and literally) and he would become a healthy mature young man. Taking on the moniker of Nightwing and becoming a much more upbeat and hopeful superhero instead of a glum and serious one.

...

So as you can see, this hypothetical single unified Robin is basically an amalgamation of all the different Robins put into a single character that goes on what is surprisingly enough a pretty good character arc that fits together rather nicely.

1656995334,ARISTEUWPE,dark crisis #2 spoilers,"Not really SPOILERS(but it has some spoilers) , just some my opinions about the issue:

 I remember when Williamson said that Dark Crisis would be a wild ride to the Titans fans, and u know, I thought ""oh, something will happen to them"" but after all it's just because he decided to destroy the Tower, put Slade defeating them , ""killing"" characters, and all of that without them having any lines⁉️, besides Nightwing ofc! He is DC's favorite Batboy lol. DC really hates the Titans because there's no reason to nerf them just to make Deathstroke win a battle when they could just have put Deathstroke going to Bludhaven to kill Nightwing (because Slade literally says he's only interested in Nightwing), I wonder if that was the original plan but the bat editorial didn't let it happen because it would break the Tumblr life of Nightwing in his current run🚶, anyway, Titans are never beating the crisis's punchbag allegations",DCcomics

1656928123,Sorrowshowls,How would Batman react to this?,"I'm writing a fanfiction of DC with my character having the grace of Lucifer from Supernatural, 

My MC, let's call him Sam for now,

Sam is a Muslim, he was just praying until he after prayer, blacked out and found himself in a garbage bin, with a energy inside of him he couldn't possibly comprehend.

It whispered to him that it could do so much for him as long as he asked, and well, he did.

He always wanted a white suit and a healthier body which it gave him.

He thought this was a dream, cause he heard about people having lucid dreams though he never experienced one himself.

As he walked through an alley he heard sounds of struggle and saw a man assaulting a woman, 

He saw the injustice and wanted to stop it, the power inside him told him, he just needed to say the word, though as he was about to, a man in a bat suit crashed down from the sky and beat the man up, 

Sam was perplexed, this dream was getting weirder and weirder, was that really Batman?

He walked closer and as he did, he wanted to know who the man was and why he was doing this, 

His power as such brushed against the mind of the criminal and saw that he had committed many crimes such as, murder, theft, r*p*, slave trafficking for the Penguin, and that this was the second time he escaped from prison.

And as he saw all that he was disgusted.

He was quite a religious person and was taught right and wrong from his parents, was taught by them to be forgiving, but not silent in the face of oppression and injustice.

He knew Batman would just throw him back into prison with a couple of broken bones, and was not satisfied with that.

He wanted the man to be punished, and the power whispered again that he only needed to say the word, and so he did.

""Bleed"" he whispered and as he did, the criminal started to bleed from his ears and eyes, he was squaling like a pig, until he exploded.

And the Bat saw all of it...

---------------------

This is of course a rough draft I will go more in detail when I write the real thing, but I am interested in with Batman would do after this?

Would he call the justice league? Talk Sam down, and if if doesn't work go against him?

Would Batman be in the right going against him? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.

Also, so that I don't blaspheme, I'll just say that all these powers aren't real and only God Has the power to do all this.

1656909816,mrtiktak2000,My better DCEU," I made a better DCEU.

Feature presentations:

Batman Begins (2005) (this dceu will have some real-life movies)

Just Batman Begins

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Man of Steel

Superman Origin story, Superman is played by Brandon Routh. (This isn't connected to superman returns because that movie doesn't exist here) The Main Villains are Metallo and Lex Luthor.

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder Woman

Just the wonder woman movie from real life (will have aquaman after credits scene)

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lantern

The Real-life movie, but better.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League

Kind of like Zack Snyder's Justice League, except cyborg isn't in it. Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter are a part of the team. And the movie is a bit funnier. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aquaman

Just the real-life movie

&amp;#x200B;

Shazam

Just the real-life movie

&amp;#x200B;

The Flash

Captain Cold and Heatwave are the villains. (Will have Wally West after credits scene) idk too much for the plot tho.

&amp;#x200B;

Hawkman

Will have Hawkman and Hawkgirl do sum, idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Suicide Squad

Will be the suicide squad from 2016, but it's a lot better.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Man of Steel 2

This movie will have General Zod come to earth. Supergirl will be in it too. (Kind of like Man of Steel except Zod doesn't die he gets sent to the phantom zone.)

&amp;#x200B;

The Dark Knight

Just the dark knight but with references to the justice league and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League vs. Legion of Doom

Now Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Shazam, and Supergirl are a part of the Justice League. The Justice League will have Lex Luthor, Joker, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Black Manta, Cheetah, and General Zod In the legion of doom. They will fight, I guess. Justice League wins. (Just imagine the fun plot)

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lantern 2

The Sinestro Corp War. It will have John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner becoming Green Lanterns. (It sounds like a lot for one movie, but we’ll make it work.)

&amp;#x200B;

The Atom

Idk what this is about, but Ryan Choi is the atom so that's cool.

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder Woman 1984

Justice League 3

Kind of a filler story, just imagine this movie. Kid Flash, Plastic Man and The Atom also join the Justice League.

&amp;#x200B;

The Dark Knight Rises

Will be different from the real life version. Batman doesn’t die, and we introduce nightwing who was robin in between movies. And Barbara Gordon as Batgirl is here too.

Will be the real life movie, but Batgirl and Green Arrow are here too.

&amp;#x200B;

The Flash 3

Flash fights Godspeed. And Flash dies so Wally West becomes the new flash.

&amp;#x200B;

Shazam vs. Black Adam

Shazam Black Adam showdown!

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Atom

I don't know much about Captain Atom, so I don't know what this movie would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Suicide Squad 2

Just the movie The Suicide Squad from real life, but it also has Deadshot.

&amp;#x200B;

Martian Manhunter

Will be a prequel that shows The Martians being killed by Darkseid and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Apokolips War Part 1

Will have all the previous heroes join the Justice League. (Except Deadman and the suicide squad.) Darkseid would show up and beat everybody's #sses. (i haven’t read a ton of comics soooooooooo this movie will be a movie..

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Apokolips War Part 2

Idkkk other than they beat Darkseid, Batman and Supergirl die, Mr. Miracle and the other new gods helped the Justice League, and the movie was good. (idk much about this story im sorryyy.)

Just a movie about katana.

&amp;#x200B;

A good movie with Black Canary and Green Arrow doing sumthin. 

&amp;#x200B;

1656907469,The_Lost_Chromosome,Do people actually live on Apokolips? or is it just slaves and Parademons?,"One thing that's always confused me about Apokolips is it just looks like a giant red rock with a bunch of firey pits and Darkseids layer being like the only building.

Like are there housing and apartments? Is there a civilization, tows, city, country sides? Like wtf even goes down on Apokolips?? 

If Darkseid has all these slaves in his control, wtf do they even do if they're is nothing going on?? Like are they mining mineral's? Are they his house cleaners or are they building stuff?? But from what I see they're are no buildings!!! 

It's confusing because Darkseid makes himself out to be this super powerful guy who should be feared but it looks like his planet hasn't evolved past the stone age. It's so plain, so bare bones!!! At least New Genesis is thriving. They evolved so well!! They got beautiful cloud city's and a safe civilization for all, they are thousands of years ahead in technology and clearly give a shit about keeping there planet in good condition. New Genesis actually gives a shit!!

It seems to me like Darkseid is just a lazy, unmotivated, jealous fedora tippin' man who's having a rage fit all the time. I mean no wonder he's always at war with New Genesis or Earth, he's probably jealous af!! These planets have achieved what Darkseid could never as a ruler. 

I mean please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, I'd love to know if Apokolips is actually a thriving planet growing and evolving, I'd love to hear some Apokolips history and lore. To me it just seems like a bunch of nothingness, so maybe they just never show it??

Idk.. this kinda just crossed my mind while I was eating breakfast, like Apokolips is so boring, just blow it up, not like there is anyone there to die from it!!!",DCcomics

1656860120,Available_Range1851,Potential Headcanon: Jason was considered the most brutal/violent Robin because he matched Batman's brutality. Dick as the OG Robin was obviously kicking ass but was not as brutal as Batman was at such a young age.,"I'm sure this has been said over and over again before. But it has honestly bothered me that Jason was considered reckless and violent when he was just following his mentor. Again this is not a new concept and probably has been said before. 

Now the thing about Dick being less violent may or may not be true, I have not done that much research into how violent Dick was as Robin. There are probably panels that show they may have been the same level of brutality and the writers just really hated Jason. 

But in my mind the reason Jason was considered more reckless/dangerous was because his violence was on par with Batman. And honestly he probably had the recklessness of any other kid.

 Please don't hate in the comments, Dick was an amazing Robin obviously, as the OG. Just wanted to offer this comparison to see what people think. Keep it civil though",DCcomics
1656858375,DeathLight7000,How DC has treated Tim over the years is shameful,"So after eleven years Tim Drake is finally getting an ongoing series but even as a longtime Tim Drake fan I am just not excited at all and that is mainly because of how DC has handled and treated Tim over the past decade. 

He was one of the best characters in the Batfamily post crisis in my opinion the reasons why he was so great was because of his growth as a character going from Robin to Red Robin.

 However ever since the New 52 he's has struggled to stay relevant he got put into a Teen titans book that nobody read or liked, his origin got retconned everything that was great about the character felt like it was stripped away (I assume this was all Dan Didio's handiwork).

In Rebirth in James Tynion's run on detective a lot of what he lost in the New 52 got restored somewhat like his origin, his relationship with Steph but during James Tynion's run he was also ""killed"" off and was therefore sidelined for awhile when you wanted to see mire of him. 

After that he started appearing in Young Justice in which Bendis started hyping up his new identity which I was also pretty excited for fans came up with so many names but the result was so disappointing. 

Then after that series got cancelled he just stayed in limbo for awhile making sporadic appearances here and there this is something that has happened with him a lot ever since his solo got cancelled in New 52 and it's so frustrating for a fan to see his favorite character just disappear from comics altogether.

Then we got the Urban legends story which was controversial some of people liked it some people hated it I personally didn't have a problem with it(the only problem I have with it was how they ended his relationship with Steph) if it actually meant he would get more spotlight and attention from DC but after that story came out there was a lot of months of just absolutely nothing, he fell into a limbo again.

Finally the solo series was eventually announced and the choice of the writer really doesn't make me wanna read it. The recently released Young justice issue was quite bad with many characters written out of character and the pride special wasn't great either.
 
I really want the series to be good but I just don't think it's going to be I hope that his relationship with Barnard doesn't take priority over him being a superhero because at the end of the day it's a series about a superhero and him being a superhero should take priority above all else.",DCcomics

Some may disagree, but to me character design is what makes a comic character. No matter how bad the personality is, having a good look or idea of a look makes the character at least decent and the comic would always be pleasant to my eye.

1656786249,Available_Range1851,Can someone please explain the full extent of the Homo Magi?,"I've been doing a lot of research about the magic world within DC Universe. So far I understand that the Homo Magi are a hidden community and that Zatanna's mother was a Homo Magi. 

Like I know that John Constantine isn't a Homo Magi but he is someone who has more magical abilities than the average person. But generally Zatanna is known to have a natural affinity to magic because she is Homo Magi. And there are people who are descended from Fae like Tim Hunter who have the ability to use magic. There are people like Raven who are half human, half demon but because of her demon she has access to magic as well. 

Also if Homo Magi are just a certain evolution of humans does that mean there are other Homo Magi's around the world? Does that mean a kid could just be born as Homo Magi? 

I know that John Constantine deals with anything Occult. Then what does Zatanna do? I feel like despite being a part of the magic world she very rarely goes as dark as John Constantine despite their on-off relationship.

I've read over and over that magic is science people don't understand yet. But is there also a master post that could explain the way magic works in the DC world?

1656753080,Internetz-Sailor,Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho Comics.,"Since watching the ""Harley Quinn"" animated series, I've gotten interested into the supervillain known as Dr. Psycho. I'm not a DC comics reader, most of my knowledge is thanks to the animated series (please don't hate me), and it's through Harley Quinn that I first learned of Wonder Woman's arch nemesis.

Dr.Psycho was unlike any supervillain I've ever seen in a super hero show. A  small person psychic that is a psychologist and a misogynist and enjoys to inflict cruelty on others. And I've been wanting to know more about him. I've searched for him on Wikipedia, fan wiki, YouTube, and such. Unfortunately there isn't much info, and he remains largely obscured within mainstream. But even if there is info of him, I want to enjoy him through comics since that is the best way.

So I ask you, fans: what are some good comics that have Dr. Psycho as the main antagonist? I mainly want to read stories that are about Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho exclusively. Or comics that explore his origin. Or villain focused comics.

And to clarify, I'm looking for the second version of Dr. Psycho. The one that is only a telepath/psychic, the version on which the Harley Quinn version is based of. I'm also fine with old and modern Wonder Woman comics. As I've said before, I want the focus of the comic to be Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho. It's also fine if it's Giganta and Dr. Psycho vs Wonder Woman-since they seem to be a villain duo on occasion.

Thanks, and much appreciation for your help.",DCcomics

* He'd love to tackle Ted Kord Blue Beetle
* He wants to play in the ""unused"" section of the DCU
* Wants to explore the DC universe, is cramming as much stuff as possible 
* ""It's very strange people love my work and it's very exciting"" 
* Big event in the Flash book next year 
* I asked ""did you mean Flash book as in singular or Flash books as in plural""? Only one Flash book for now, but he will literally take on any book DC gives him
* Really appreciates the kind words/comments people leave on Twitter.
* Original way Tim Sheridan (who Adams is very good friends with)  and Adams had a FP idea and their editor said ""lets talk to Geoff"". They went into a room, and broke things up like a TV show. Adams is a big fan of Geoff's work, and is learning a lot from him.
* His FortNite crew is texting him during this Spaces 
* Jeremy Adams' dad drew a Captain Atom run, including one that Greg Weisman worked on.
* Second Mortal Kombat movie he worked on had 40 minutes cut due to time. - He did a lego Flash movie, he had an idea where the Justice League turned the Hall of Justice into the Mall of Justice (Superman cooking hot dogs, Batman making vitamin smothies) but he couldn't fit it in due to lack of time in the film
* The Legion of Doom issue was a dream come true because he loves Kevin M. and the JLI. He thought DC was pranking him when they suggested it. He will pay for the original art for that issue, if Kevin M. is listening 
* HE'S HAD LUNCH WITH MARK WAID A FEW TIMES. Adams is trying to live up to Waid's Flash run. 
* He feels ""the weight"" of Wally's fans embracing his run. 
* It was Adams idea to do the Quantum Leap arc. The HiC moment was one of ""closure"" for him, the fans, and the character. 
* He has a Flash event planned that will involve all Flash characters, including Max and Jesse",DCcomics

1656724652,NoctSora,[Discussion] So the Tim Drake Special made Tim look bad and did Steph dirty,"My biggest issue with the Tim Drake Pride Special is how both Tim and Steph were written.

Tim came across a massive jerk as he dumped Steph without a reason, and then ghosted her for months and quickly entered a new relationship from the get go  and he was actively avoiding her and it was only by chance he came across her again. He also had the nerve to ask Steph if she was mad at him. Not to mention during their talk he said she has always been everything he ever wanted and more? If that is the case then why dump and ghost her? It makes him look flaky and non-commited to their relationship as while he did dump her before realizing he was bi, the story indicates that due to his questioning sexuality did he dump her which overlaps with this.

There was also the fact that introducing your partner who you had a very intense relationship with after dumping them for no reason, ghosting them and reconnecting by accident to your new partner without telling them is a very inconsiderate and selfish thing to do. He should have asked Steph first if she wanted to meet him. It's like he was expecting them to be friends without even asking if that was what Steph wanted. In the past Tim was hesitant to introduce Steph to his new girlfriends as he knew it would be awkward and have some tension, so this is OOC for him as well.

Steph was treated badly as well. She instantly forgives Tim and then upon meeting Bernard fangirls over him and says it is ""the best day ever"". Aside from the fact NO ONE would act like that upon being treated like she was, it made her look like a prop just to shill Bernard and reassure twitter/tumblr that she isn't a threat to Bernard. She has also NEVER acted like this when meeting Tim's other partners. She acted polite, awkward or showed jealously but subdued. Not allowing her to have complex feelings on the most important romantic relationship of her history/life denies her agency and is a huge disservice to her.",DCcomics

I’m going to be starting a few other series as well since a lot of new creative teams are taking over some series like detective comics. I recently picked up dark crisis issue 1 without any prior knowledge really. I understand that the Justice league is “dead”, like Batman and Superman. Which leads me to my main question of how the continuity works for DC comics. If Batman is “dead” then how is his series still ongoing.

1656683207,trover2345325,[Other] What happens if Warner Bros have their own Book division and reduce DC as a brand label for their book division,"You know, Warner Bros own DC comics right? 

Well, what  if Warner Bros is going to make their own book division that will publish comic books and novels both original and based on licensed properties, then DC  the comic book company Warner Bros owned will no longer be a company but will be reduced as Brand labels and be part of WB's publishing division. 

And if  DC comics is reduced as brand labels for WB's publishing division, then that means  DC will only publish DC superhero stories and will no longer  publish licensed properties like  Looney tunes  and Scooby-Doo  comic book stories including adaptation of Warner bros shows which is now handled by Warner Bros own book division as DC will only publish their superhero properties like Superman,batman,Wonder Woman and more. 

But off-note, if  Warner Bros  make their own book division and turn DC  into a brand and is  part of their book division .Maybe, I think a hard reboot is needed for the DC universe, think about it whenever a comic book writer and artist becomes showrunner they will be in charge and give their reimagined take of  the DC universe and the characters with a beginning to end for few years , while the classics will live on as standalone stories .",DCcomics

Where would a new fan start? It seems a daunting task, getting in this late, and part of me is embarrassed to even be here asking. But I want to get more involved and entrenched in the universe as a whole so on top of my main question, “where should I start?” here are a few other side questions:

Is it even worth starting anything pre new 52? I’m aware of events up to crisis on infinite earths but that’s about it, and again only on a very surface level. 

Does the dc animated universe, specifically the films, cover enough of the source material to skip around? Or should I go back and read the source material for those films? 

Is there anything that is not worth my time? A silly question I know but honestly if there’s anything not worth the read I’d rather know now so I don’t waste my time on it. I’m not necessarily speaking about storylines or arcs that aren’t canon, if it’s good it’s good, more so poor writing, unnecessary or convoluted series, irrelevant or boring stuff, etc.

1656617767,BonelessBanshee,Best DC comics for somebody not really into mainstream superheroes ?,"I'm not totally against them - in fact I love a lot of Batman's stuff. But I've never been into all the really tropey good guy vs bad guy super hero action. It just isn't deep enough for me. I love a well developed story and/or world; and a great character is a necessity. I prefer somebody who isn't omnipotent or has obvious plot armor.. Somebody who struggles as we all do. And I prefer the threats around them to be well developed as well, I can get around the threats if the protagonist(s) are well developed; but somebody who has fallen into evil for a very relatable human desire I often find most compelling.

For example; The reason I like Batman a lot is everything around him is well developed. We have the entirety of Gotham City with all its nooks and crannies full of malicious intent waiting to be uncovered. Many of the villains fell into their personas due to their own falls from grace, mental illness, or greed. And Batman himself is only a human with fancy gadgets, as well as a traumatized child and a victim to the worst kind of robbery - life.

So for those of you who enjoy a well developed narrative similarly, what have you enjoyed ? My mind is fresh within DC, as well as comics in general. So please nothing that requires too much if any background knowledge.",DCcomics

1656587655,GrantM1984,What Was The Fan Reaction To Tara Strong Taking Over As Harley Quinn In 2011 And Has Fan Opinion Changed On Her Since Then,"This is something I've been curious about for quite a while now. We can all agree that Arleen Sorkin will always be the definitive voice of Harley (as well as the inspiration for the characters creation).
But since she retired in 2011, Tara has pretty much become the defacto voice of Harley.
True other VAs have done Harley from Hynden Walch to Kaley Cuoco to Mellisa Rauch, etc and I do think they've done a good job but Tara's the one WB/DC have kept going back to for over a decade now.
I'm curious to know what people thought of her as Harley back when Arkham City came out and all the way up to today. Personally I do like her Harley (but maybe because I love Raven and her take on Batgirl in the DC Super Hero Girls series (the latter I loved so much I bought a replica of the hoodie she wears as Barbara Gordon) so maybe I admit some bias) but every so often I'll see someone claim she's terrible, that she makes Harley sound like a high pitched toddler, that she's kinda taken credit for the success of the character due to how often she's voiced Harley, etc.
Any thoughts?",DCcomics

1656513732,Neither_Prize_8386,My redesign of the Star Saphire's Emblem and Emotional Entity,"So in my previous post, I mentioned how I was trying to redesign the star sapphire's because of how dumb the emotional entity is and also how out of place the symbol is. So eventually I came to the conclusion of making the new version a plant. My reason is, A, it's the only life form not used in the other designs of the emotional entities, and B, still works when implamenting both the caring side and parasitic side of love. So anyway below is the redesign of the symbol, it represents the emotional entity of The Caretaker, a large planet-spanning plant being. Just like the original Star Sapphires (btw there just called the violet lanterns now for obvious reasons) it recruits members with a great deal of love and makes them become obsessive with that love and imprison that thing to maintain it. However there are a few key differences, first, they imprison the things they love in sap not crystals, second, it's no longer just romantic love it can be any love as long as it can be sealed (like it can't be love for violence unless I can work that in somehow) even entire nations! Because of the third reason, once the item or person is sealed in the sap it's taken back to the homeworld where the Caretaker resides and placed in its forest to be kept intact as long as the lantern helps in also maintaining the Caretaker's forest. Also, no more men aren't included in the corps bs, men aren't exclusive to rage and violence and women aren't exclusive to love. Anyway, that's my redesign of the Violet Lantern corps please let me know what you think and if I should change anything. P.s. if you say to change the color, I will inform you it is violet according to the colors on the program I made it with.

1656511468,Some-Dog9800,"I know it's been done to death, but here's my concept for how the DCEU should have gone (includes Phase 1)"," **PHASE 1: Return of Heroes**

* **The Flash vs The Rogues -** Barry Allen searches around the world for a hidden nuclear bomb using his superspeed as he’s ambushed by several of his Rogues hired to delay his search. It’s eventually revealed that the bomb is not actually a nuclear bomb, but a gene-bomb, brought from the future by the film’s main villain, Professor Zoom. The gene-bomb interacts with a metahuman’s metagene and activates it. Flash finds it but is unable to stop it from going off as Zoom pulls him into the speed force for a final confrontation. This triggers a Metahuman Outbreak throughout Markovia.
* **The Manhunter From Mars -** While working as a private detective under the name “John Jones”, the Martian Manhunter is confronted by his brother, martian scientist Ma’alefa’ak. Meanwhile, a shadow organization known as Helix led by the mysterious Mister Bones intent on documenting and counteracting alien presence on Earth targets both Ma’alefa’ak and the Martian Manhunter. Bones’ metagene was activated while he was still in the womb, causing his mother to die instantly upon his birth from the cyanide compound constantly exuding from his skin. Ma’alefa’ak kills Mister Bones in the climax. By the end of the film, Helix has evolved into the DEO, now affiliated with the government, still somehow led by Mr. Bones despite his prior death.
* **Wonder Woman: Battle of the Seven Seas -** .With Atlantis and Themyscira on the brink of war, Wonder Woman allies with Aquaman to uncover a conspiracy. The main villains are Queen Clea and Myrina. Clea is the despotic ruler of Venturia, a remote kingdom in the Atlantean continent. She plans to use growing conflicts in order to weaken the other Atlantean kingdoms and eventually take control of the entire continent. She uses Myrina, a former Amazon who left the island prior to Diana’s birth to work as an assassin on Man’s Isles\* to fuel the conflict. Myrina is killed in battle by the Amazon Phillipus during the climax. Orm is the king at this point, and is killed by Vulko in the climax. Ocean Master is portrayed as misguided rather than downright evil.
* **The Adventures of Superman -** As he moves to Metropolis and begins working at the Daily Planet, Clark Kent encounters a series of villains in his first year as Superman. First, Superman battles a Neo-Nazi terrorist known as Atoman targeting jewish-owned businesses using Intergang weaponry, who was inspired by Superman to don a colorful persona for his activities, believing him to be the first of the “Aryan ubermensch” that the Nazi Regime spoke of. Secondly, he and Lois investigate the weapons distribution ring, Intergang and expose Moxie Mannheim as their leader. Finally, a LexCorp scientist named Joseph Martin has his metagene activated and becomes the Atomic Skull following an “accident” orchestrated by Lex Luthor so he could lure out Superman, fascinated by and envious of the Man of Steel. Superman battles the Atomic Skull in the heart of Metropolis. This film is an anthology containing three separate stories connected by plot threads such as Intergang and Superman’s growing influence over the people of Metropolis, which culminates into a climax in which the people of Metropolis help Superman in his battle against Atomic Skull.
* **Batman: Phosphorus -** In this film, Batman faces Dr. Alexander Sartorius, better known as Dr. Phosphorus, whose metagene was activated following an accident in a nuclear power plant. Phosphorus blackmails the Gotham City Council by threatening to expose the council’s covering up the accident that made him in order to establish himself as a key figure in Gotham organized crime. Phosphorus also kidnaps his former lab partner, Kirk Langstrom, seeking to use his research into the Man-Bat formula to enhance his understanding of the metagene. Introduced are several key Gotham mafia players such as Alberto Falcone, Killer Croc and Baby Doll, Nocturna, El Flamingo, Ventriloquist, Hush, and the Great White Shark. The Bat-Family is hinted at in this film and explored in more detail later in the saga.
* **Green Arrow and the Black Canary -** Shortly after returning to Star City from years on an island, Green Arrow targets the China White Triad alongside Black Canary. Mainly serves to introduce Green Arrow and his world.
* **Justice League: Dominion -** The first Justice League movie features the Dominators ( as main villains. Initially, they target Earth as they fear the rise of metahumans on the planet. They experiment on members of the human race with the metagene in order to enhance members of their species as well as understand its nature, and discover that it is activated under intense pressure. This is done from the nation of Markovia, the epicenter of metahuman activity since the metahuman outbreak in “The Flash”, and enabled by Markovia’s leaders. Eventually, they learn how to impact metahumans using weapons that target the gene. The film features the formation of the League to stop the Dominators. Lex Luthor assists the Justice League, interested in the Dominators’ research into the metagene. At the end of the film, Lex begins a program to house metahumans experimented on by the Dominators and help develop their powers in order to further his own nefarious ends.

\*It is revealed later that Myrina had Grail, the daughter of Darkseid, in this time.

Phase 2 explores the cosmic and mystical sides of the DC Universe, introducing the Green Lanterns in their own film saga and the Homo Magi. With existing characters introduced in phase 1, their sequels will delve into these two aspects through the villains they face. Batman 2 is based on Grant Morrison's run, featuring the Black Glove, and foreshadowing Batman's apparent death/journey across time through flashbacks to Simon Hurt's backstory and a cameo from Insider during the epilogue. Wonder Woman's sequel explores the Olympian Pantheon, and Superman's sequel involves an alien or mystic villain. I may post an outline for phase 2 later when it's completed.",DCcomics

I grew up watching those two shows, so many fantastic memories of my dad “sneaking” me out of my room after my bed time to watch it with him, and all the action figures I would get! Flash was my favorite in those days, and the only way my mom could get me to clean my room was to tell me “If you can do it fast enough, maybe you’ll even impress the flash!”

I hadn’t seen either show in years but I saw a clip a while back and hopped on HBO Max to watch them, and at this point I’ve rewatched both series about 3 times in the past few months. After going back I can really appreciate the approach to storytelling and narrative with it as well, the writing is phenomenal, and I can’t explain how much I love the “Hereafter” arc!

DC did a collab with Almost Skateboards back in the day and released these so I picked up the set. They’re super high quality and awesome as art for the wall, but I’ve got to get rid of some clutter in my basement and figured someone else might be interested. I’ve also got a couple other DC collab decks from before the DKR release as well. One with the full Justice League and villains and one with only Batman. Link below. Thanks!

1656374240,JDevil202,Question Who are all the main superhero who have hold the title of Batman or been Batman?,"So I am plan on making videos about superhero both marvel and DC and I wanna go over each superhero and supervillains for each character, my reason for this is that comic books have been around for a while, there are so many characters so I wanna help any new people get into a certain comic or superhero and giving them a brief explanation is a good way to do it.

for marvel I am gonna start off with Batman so I am asking who are all the main people who held the title of Batman

I am well aware of Bruce and Terry holding the title of Batman but are there any other people who have been Batman? also I keep asking for main Batman because I wanna avoid people who where Batman 1 time or in an alternate universe that isn't cannon or like movie only spider men etc etc !

like I know the joker taking over Bruce body in the game was Batman, Dick was Batman in one of the movie, bruce father was Batman in an alternate universe, but I won't count them since they where not cannon or they was temporally batman!",DCcomics
1656369095,iamjustreallytired,I love Wayne family adventures SO MUCH,"So I initially wasn't going to get into it because I heard some mixed reviews saying it was very heavily fanfiction so I thought eh I can go without it but then my parents took away my other stuff because exams so I decided to download webtoon and read up. 

And OH MY GOD !? 

I've read about 20 chapters till now (started last night lol) and I love it to bits. It's SO CUTE and it's all the content I've wanted from the batfam. The characters are actually pretty well and coherently written and treated with respect. The writers definitely did their research so it doesn't feel out of touch with the canon. There's growth and character development which is so refreshing to see. 

I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea and I respect that; personally I love that they're showing the family as flawed humans who are trying to be better and for me that's what good characters have always been about. (Instead of being rebooted to the same arc over and over again because edge lords on the internet think heroes should also be sad and brooding fighting machines)

I don't even care if it's just fanfiction this is MY canon. I love it SO SO MUCH AHHH I actually tear up when I read it because well ITS REALLY CUTE

1656358316,BrunoDiaz2099,"Unpopular opinion: Most sidekicks trigger suspension of disbelief, but not all of them","Some can bounce bullets or have the right age, but most can be killed with a bullet and the police would press charges against their mentors. A huge green elephant can be killed with a bullet or an arrow and if the police can barely tolerate Batman, the entire city would be outraged by the sight of a 12 years old following him in bright colors with no pants.

That being said, a teenager with the kind of skills Superboy, Wonder Girl or Damian have, would certainly need an outlet. They are natural field agents. 

I don't mean that there shouldn't be a Robin. But in the case of Dick, Jason and Tim, they should be training and assisting from the cave until they become legal. Batman: The Animated Series handled Dick very well, but Tim not so much. Keep in mind that the original reason for Robin was to have a Watson. Well, Alfred became a more logical choice, but thanks to online communication, now underaged Robins can do it from the cave. 

As for the Titans, it's just the same, underaged Robins can command from the computer. Some Titans are powerhouses on a JLA level, but Roy, Garth, Gar and Vic can be killed by a thug with a gun. 

Archer are at the bottom of the food chain. It makes sense for Robin Hood but now it's like trying to block the impact of a train with an umbrella. Green bullet makes sense, green arrow... Not so much.

Other teenagers that make sense are independent acts, like Static or Blue Beetle III (or Spider-man). They are doing it on their own and they have the chops. 

The common reply to this is that it is fiction, and yes, it doesn't need to be realistic, but it does need to have verisimilitude. The physics of guns are the same and the police and justice system are not easy on vigilantes there, why would they go easy on teenage sidekicks?",DCcomics

For me I just can’t help but laugh at the fact that DC just “deleted” Blüdhaven as a fictional setting back in 2006, and kinda stuck with that for a decade. 

However, what takes the cake for me is the New 52 timeline where Batman had 4  Robins in 5 years (Well 3 technically b/c IIRC Tim Drake was never a Robin in that timeline).

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

We’ve got Year ones for Batman, Dick(Robin and Batman is a great one for Dick), and batgirl - we’ve had the new 52 for Cass and Steph. Over the years continuity changes slightly with each new run.

Given all of this, I feel like I’ve never heard of a modern rewrite for Death in the family. The story is incredibly iconic, but I feel like not many people know what happened after Jason actually died. Back then, Robin’s death was followed by a Joker plot with him posing as the UN’s Ambassador of Iran.

If Batman isn't the 2nd, Wonder Woman is the obvious choice, Being the greatest female superhero and all that

How was it in collective agreement that Jon Kent would be aged up? and on the opposite end,  what’s stopping a writer from killing off a major character like let’s say Blue Beetle? Or making it canon that wonder woman loses an eye?  Sorry if this is a silly question I know next to nothing about how comics work and i’m trying to get into them more.",DCcomics
1656241211,AutoModerator,Have a question? Ask the veterans of DC Comics!,"Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

I read the long Halloween dark victory, year one, dark knight returns etc. I figured from some articles I read that I should just start with the New 52 court of owls. I purchased the monthly subscription from Dc universe infinite and have started the court of owls and I love it. I was just wondering do I read all 52 issues and then move to rebirth next?

Now, my Marvel knowledge is already big enough, so I wanted to get a good look at DC but there is no way of properly consuming, well... anything here in Germany.

We don't have HBO Max or DC Universe so we are limited to the rights that Amazon Prime and Netflix purchaed (which only include the Arrowverse's series as well as some other like Titans or Gotham, the only animated media is Teen Titans GO! I think).

So, if I can't get the films or series, I wanted to read the comics - but as it turns out, there is no way of reading the comics legally (at least in my country), so I don't even get the chance to (legally) like or know DC's works without having to spend a bunch of space and money for comics.

The nfts are great. 

Just kidding. $20 withdrawal fee (easy palm studio or DC profit)

The Batman AMC early screening nft, ALL #s were just different angles, OF ONLY THE BAT MOBILE. 
The legendary looks exactly like the common. 
(good thing sold before sinking prices) 

Now, I wanna rant about the bat cowls. $300 for a bat cowl and nobody I buying the ones over... $300. 

They ALL look the same, except sometimes the ears are longer to look like horns or the mouth is a different shape. Other than that, it's just all multi colored. 

Someone has been trying to sell that all yellow cowl for 5k down to 1k now, and it just looks like a goblin.

1656189395,Superboy_Fan,"[Discussion]What does everyone think of DC's branding, The New Age of DC Heroes from 2018","So if you don't don't know, in 2018 DC started a new branding known as the The New Age of DC Heroes , which was meant to tie into Dark Knights: Metal. Dan Didio who was the then publisher of DC at the time and he was overseeing this initiative that was meant to bring all sorts of original heroes into the DCU instead of Legacy heroes( Which Didio hated).

These Titles included

Damage, The Silencer, Sideways, The Terrifics, The Curse of Brimstone, The Immortal Men, New Challengers, and The Unexpected

This intiative which ran from 2018 to 2020 was considered a financial failure, and none of the  new heroes they were trying to set up were never seen again

they have some preexisting heroes and concepts used in this such as the Terrifics which was composed of Metamorpho, Phantom Girl, Plastic man and Mister Terrific, this unsuprisingly was the longest running comic of this branding because it used well known characters. the other comics with used an already familiar concept was the new Challengers which was a new team of the Challengers of the Unknown.

Who knows maybe if Dan Didio's DCU had come into fruition where all the DC heroes aged realistically maybe these heroes would have had a future in that if Dan hadn't been fired and this world would have been made. some of the heroes have showed up in other comics, such as Sideways showing up in Bendis's Young Justice run, so maybe these characters can show up at some point but they have not showed up in the last 2 years.

What do you guys think of this branding and do you guys think some of these characters have potential? let me know:)",DCcomics

But, I think he probably also worked for the CIA as a wet work agent. I base this off the line from the Dark Knight where he says, ""If your good at something, never do it for free"". He says this after one of the mobsters asks him why he hadn't already killed Batman.

1656163952,fox07_tanker,Snyders Batman to quippy," For as much as I love Scott Snyder's Batman, I feel like his new versions of batman (specificity his Justice League run) was way too quippy.

I just started reading Batman Who Laughs for the first time today, and 10 pages in Batman is already making jokes. This honestly feels like something Kevin Smith would write, not the genius who brought us a nearly perfect portrayal of Batman in the New 52.

I want to read the rest of the series just to see more banter between Augustus and Raquel or more scenes with Buck Wild, or even to see if they interact with more characters in the main DCU like how Rocket and Superboy played off each other (Superboy learning what a belly button is will live in my memory forever).

Villains like Joker and Riddler both have prominent silly and serious appearances, whereas villains like Professor Pyg had to be changed into completely different characters. It’s why the fuller rogues gallery hasn’t been getting as much attention as of late, only new one from the 00s were Hush and Red Hood, and the only one from past that was the Court of Owls.

1656076402,Macapta,So why do Yellow Lantern rings choose their users like that?,"Other rings choose their users based on how strongly they feel and can channel the attributed emotion. Hal has a lot of Will so he gets a green. Lard lees is greedy as hell so he gets the orange. Atrocitus is as angry as someone can get so he gets a red etc. 

But yellows are chosen for their ability to instil fear in others, not because they feel immense fear themselves. I jus find it odd since if the user is not producing the emotion, then what is powering and channeling the ring to make its constructs? If the ring pulled from the fear of those around it, then it would never be able to be proactive and unable to create fear, since fear is first required to use the ring. 

I get that it would be hard to have a villainous faction that can barely fight due to being too terrified of everything, but I still think it would work to have the users be very fearful people.

**Superman #8**

**Story 4**

There is an epidemic of crime in Metropolis, and they are all dope addicts!  Shootings in the street almost kill both Lois and some children  The dealer, however, has a good lawyer that always gets them off.  Superman lures them into a trap by catching them red-handed trying to steal morphine.  The slimy lawyer gets them off.  Clark then attends a party at one of their houses and catches them murdering an accomplice.  They attempt to burn the body, but Superman grabs them, stuffs them in a van, crushing the door, and then calls the cops.  All are arrested.

This is a really short description, mostly because the comic itself is very generic.  It barely interests me, considering the sheer insanity of all the ones that came before it.  Superman throwing them in a deliver van and then crushing the end of it so they can't escape was kind of cool, but other than that there's just a lot of talking and not a lot of action.  Not all comics are going to be winners I suppose.

**Action Comics #32, Cover Date: January 1941**

Clark gets a call about a man threatening to jump off a bridge.   He charges there as Superman and saves him, only for the man to tell him that he gambled away all his money at the Preston Club.  Superman then TREATENS THE MAN's LIFE NOT TO COMMITT SUICIDE (because that's how it works???) and decides to investigate the Preston Club as Clark.  He goes with the mayor to said club, but it appears to be just a gentleman's club (in the traditional sense, not the modern one you pervs).  Afterwards, however, Clark overhears that the Mayor is being blackmailed.  Lois decides to go on her own...and promptly gets discovered and drugged.  Preston sends men to kill Clark, but Superman beats them down and heads to the club, finding Lois wandering outside, in a daze.  It turns out, she took a drug to make her lose all her memories.  Although doctors can do nothing, Clark uses his hypnotic vision to bring her out of it (uh...I mean...okay?).  Clark then builds a ""Krypto-Raygun,"" which is basically something that can take pictures and then shine them on a wall like a projector.  Superman gets the pictures of the gambling, busts down the door and beats everyone up.  Preston runs to the mayor's office, where Lois is already.  It turns out, Preston gave the memory-wiping drug to the mayor's son and says he won't cure him if the mayor arrests him.  The mayor, however, has had enough and refuses to help Preston.  Preston then kidnaps them both.  Meanwhile, Superman uses his hypnosis powers to cure the mayor's son.  Superman then chases them down, saves the car from running off and cliff, and brings Preston to the police.  The mayor is worried that he'll be ruined, but Clark says he'll be just fine, since he'll testify that the mayor is being blackmailed...which apparently excuses everything he did!

Oh boy!  Back to insanity!  Okay, I don't know where Superman learned to save suicidal people, but apparently they didn't teach him logic.  Threatening a suicidal man with death is...not gonna work???  They're already suicidal??  Like...huh???  Then the mayor is involved with a racketeering scandal and also helped cover it up.  I don't think the whole ""yeah but my son!"" is really going to help him here.  If something like that happens, you're supposed to call the police.  If someone kidnapped your son and forced you to commit crimes you're still on the hook for those crimes.  Plus, the mayor is also REALLY STUPID.  Like, what motivation does the crook have to cure your son?  He's just going to string you along forever.  Finally, and apparently, Superman can build sci-fi nonsense devices and has the abilities to counter-act drugs that destroy people's brains.  Good powers to have, I guess!

**Action Comics #33, Cover Date: February 1941**

A lumber magnate changes his will to turn a lumber forest into a summer camp for boys after he dies...and then he promptly and mysteriously dies.  The brother of said magnate contests the will saying that his brother was insane at the time of writing the will, but he loses the case.  Several months later, the revenue from the company has dried up because of sabotage that has killed the workers.  Lois and Clark decide to head out to the forest to pretend to look for jobs.  When they arrive on the site the evil overseer (who DOES NOT look like the man from those Brawny paper towel commercials, I assure you) says he'll put them to work.  Later, however, the Brawny man tells the boatman working for the company to dump Lois overboard.  The boatman does so, and Lois is swept out into a whirlpool in the lake (IN VIVID COLOR that are um...totally not the colors of a lake?)  Clark, however, senses that something is wrong.  He flies over as Superman and rescues her (IN VIVID COLOR AGAIN).  Lois comes to, but the Brawny man locks them both in a cabin.  Clark uses hypnosis to stun Lois and leaps from the cabin with them both.  He then turns into Superman and springs to action and follows the Brawny man back to the head office.  Naturally at this point Lois comes to and tries to sneak in, only to get kidnapped as she usually does.  The guy in the head office wearing a mask, however, pulls out a gun and kills both the Brawny man and the boatman.  Superman then barges in.  A piece of wood, flying through the air, catches one of the bullets and ricochets back into the masked mans head (THAT'S NOT HOW BULLETS WORK!)  To the surprise of no one, it is revealed that it is the brother of the magnate, who also killed his brother and tried to sabotage the company so he could buy it up for cheap.

You know, normally I don't talk about the artwork.  It's mostly because it's all uniform and the same.  I mean, so far it's been drawn by the same people over and over again.  This time, however, I just have to mention that they way they drew the lake was objectively GORGEOUS.  Like when Lois and Superman were under the water, there were these intricate patterns of colors swirling around them.  Lois was also striking some dramatic poses with her clothes and hair floating around her.  It looked like a renaissance painting, something that should be hung in a museum.  I'm not a guy who really likes are or anything, but definitely check this one out and see what I mean.  That being said THAT'S NOT WHAT WATER LOOKS LIKE.  You don't go underwater and see a flippin' rainbow of colors, like a giant who ate a bag of skittle threw up in it.  Also, I KNOW THIS IS A COMIC BOOK and it has a loose interpretation of physics but if you SHOOT WOOD THE BULLET WILL NOT BOUNCE BACK.  Like what kind of wood are they chopping down at this lumberyard?  We should be making tanks out of that and not steel.  I'm not even sure why they bothered even giving the brother a mask, as anyone over the age of three with a grasp on object permanence could tell it was him.  Whatever, I'm not DC Comics.

1655961331,ErictheRed117,This Month Marks the Seventh Year I've Been Collecting DC Comics,"Seven years ago this month, I went to one of the comic shops in my town for the first time. I was 13 years old and had been thoroughly amazed by the comics I had been reading in the graphic novel section of the library (mostly Batman) for the past year.

There was something about comics that I had never experienced in any entertainment medium before. The covers were always flashy and promising, but the stories inside could be anything from brightly colored slugfests to moving stories about larger than life characters. I loved all of it and  wanted more. So I looked for any nearby comic shops on the internet, chose the smaller less ostentatious of the two in my town, and asked my mom to drive me over to have a look.

When I walked in, there was a a whole rack of new comics that stretched about half the length of the store, plus boxes and boxes of back issues from almost every era in comics history. There were graphic novels too, and paperback collections of series I had only read about online. There were collectors edition issues, as well as some particularly valuable issues that were way out of my price range at the time (and many still are).

Beyond that, there were plenty of other ""nerdy"" delights scattered throughout the shop; trading card games, tabletop RPGs, badass collectible figurines, and pretty much anything else one could ever want. (Later, I would briefly get into, and regularly play, Magic: The Gathering at the shop.)

The then mid-60 year old man who runs the place knew pretty much everything you could think of about all of it. Though a bit difficult to deal with at first, he helped me understand the basics of the DC universe and where I should start if I was truly interested in getting into comics. This is right after Convergence and the end of the New 52, so to say I was a little lost was an understatement. Regardless, I purchased my first new comic there, Detective Comics #41, the first issue of the second series to not be a part of the New 52.

Looking back, the storyline of that and the next few issues is god-awful (Jim Gordon replaces Bruce as the police-sanctioned Batman for a time), but at the time I didn't care. I was so excited to finally be part of something I had tentatively enjoyed for a while. Now I had the chance to throw myself into this medium and subculture for real.

And I definitely did. 7 years later, I'm 20, working towards a college degree, and generally being an adult, but I still love and respect comics. I still go to that same shop every week (and the other store in town if I have extra money) to pick up my pull list. I started reading Marvel comics too, some years back, but that's a story for a different time and subreddit.

I've definitely changed in the last 7 years and I actually partially credit comics for the good and the difficult during that time.

In the last 4 years my worldview and understanding of life have changed drastically. I was born into a very conservative Christian family. I was rarely exposed to other beliefs or ways of life, but I often got glimpses of the outside world through movies and video games. Comics, however, had arguably the biggest impact in my life. There I was exposed characters of different religions, races, sexual orientations, political views, etc.

I remember reading Batwoman: Elegy years ago. It was one of my first non-hostile introductions to the idea that same-sex relationships can be enjoyable. I remember reading Black Lightning: Year One and realizing that I, a white person, could enjoy comics starring racially diverse characters without feeling like I was being ""replaced."" So yeah. Anyone who says comics shouldn't be diverse is, well, just wrong. It can have a positive effect on readers (like me).

Similarly, during high school, my mental state fell to pieces. I had no real support from friends or family and therapy or medicine was hard to come by. But I still had comics. I got to read stories of imperfect heroes, who often had fragile mental and emotional lives, but were still able to do superhuman tasks for the benefit of others. It gave me hope and a sense of self that I desperately needed.

The idea of turning to a favored entertainment medium for support during rough times is often seen as a cliche, or worse, labeled as escapism. But for those really suffering, having something to enjoy with no strings attached; just good stories and iconic characters; can literally be a saving grace.

I won't be overly dramatic and claim that comics changed my life, but they have been a constant source of enjoyment, imagination, and progress for almost a decade now. I've changed and so have comics, but my enjoyment of them has remained constant. I love them now as much, if not more, than I did in seventh grade, when I got the first comic I could call my own. And I try to share that love with other people when I can. I have a friend who sometimes accompanies me on my comic trips and listens to my moaning about the Bat/Cat wedding that never was (seriously, fuck Tom King for that). I also bring up comics whenever I see someone wearing a piece of clothing with one of my favorite characters. You never know when somebody wearing a Batman logo can end up talking about classic comics for 10+ minutes with you (it's happened...more than once).

All of this to say, though I may bitch about DC's refusal to change their sacred status quo or allow Batman to be happy (I will never get over that wedding), I love comics. I love the characters, the stories, the themes, and everything else they bring to the table.

Thanks, DC. Here's to another 7 years and beyond.",DCcomics

Sisyphus is trapped in a cycle, not unlike batman, yet Camus encourages his audience to imagine Sisyphus happy, and if I've learned anything from GMs work, it's that imagination is more important than reality. Batman may be alone at the end of the story, but he won't be alone forever. I believe he can grow with his peers, maybe he will grow, he still has Dick, Gordon and Alfred (even though he sends him on vacay). I believe the end of Morrison's run shows that even though evil will always exist, so will the idea of us, our myths. We can create meaning in the cycle of struggle and meaninglessness.

He IS an a lister in terms of respect from other heroes and experience, as well as real world popularity. But he can still totally get rocked by lots of people


The DCAMU version of dick Grayson is probably the most accurate portrayal of him we’ve seen, over the other four main ones (BTAS, Teen Titans 2003, Young Justice, Titans). I think his arc and characterization are near perfect. His quippy wisecracks, his older brother vibes, closeness to Bruce but desire to be out of Batman’s shadow, and his mentor relationship to damian. He gets his ass beat too much but that’s a nitpick at most

He only really gets one spotlight adventure in the series: Bad Blood. While bad blood isn’t the best one in the series (inconsistent portrayal of Talia, sloppy plot, etc.) it’s still solid and does an EXCELLENT job of showing Dick’s relationship to not only Bruce, but Batman as well

(1) their inability to make sequels on time
(2) their inability to maintain the same cast
(3) their inability to decide on an overaching story and sticking to it.

An overall lack of direction.

The DCEU has more trailers than movie content.

We have a FLASH movie that we have been seeing trailer of for years now... in fact I have seen so many Flash trailers I'm just not interested. 

Somehow they couldn't keep on Henry Cavill as Superman, nor Ben Affleck as Batman. 

Why did they take so long to follow up with the justice league sequels ?

Some of these projects have been so delayed that even if they were to make a sequel now, the original cast have probably aged out.

The only thing they have got right are the standalone movies like Joker and THE BATMAN.

But everytime they try to do an interconnected story it falls flat.

This isn't  the dawn of the superhero movie, superhero movies have been popular for at least 30 years....why can't they figure it out.

I realize that the DC cinematic universe's future is somewhat in doubt, what with the Flash movie possibly rebooting it, and the Green Lantern Corps. movie not having much in the way of updates since its announcement seven or eight years ago, but I've been reading Geoff Johns' run on Green Lantern, and it got me wondering who people would want to see in a movie.

There's seven or eight Green Lanterns from Earth alone (depending on if you count Alan Scott, since he occupies a different corner of the DC universe), assuming that the Lanterns from Earth would be the focus, and I figure you could probably mix and match any two of them and come up with an entertaining team where both of them use the ring's power in different ways.

However, I'm not super familiar with the Green Lantern mythos - I only really know about Hal Jordan (and even that's mostly by reputation) and John Stewart (and that's mainly through the Justice League cartoon), so I'd be interested to see who people would want if the movie introduced two Green Lanterns into this universe.

I feel like this guy was just upset because Wally wasn't a carbon copy from the comics because he was complaining he wasn't with Linda Park in Young Justice . 

The show explains that Wally is an emphatic character. Most of the time he's comic relief but two episodes stand out. One where he tries to help the people of Apokolips despite the fact that it might start a war. There was the Flash focused episode where Orion tries to beat up Trickster where Wally instead helps him. He also explains he jokes around most of the time because he knows Superman is there to back him up.
 
The guy told me to ask people who knew their shit so here I am asking the DC comics sub. Was he a good character or not?",DCcomics

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character!

I honestly could not be paid to care about Hawkman, just nothing there for me as a character or design. And he keeps popping up I feel like",DCcomics
1655734390,sammyjamez,"Would it make sense to say that Superman has been reduced to a simple hero with godly abilities and not focused on the ideals that he represents, while Batman is continuously glorified as a perfect being in every way without focusing on his flawed humanity?","The DC heroes are most well-known for their iconography and what they are meant to represent.

The Superman icon, the original hero, is a representation of a person who has so many abilities, almost like that of a god (sometimes when more powerful than what he usually is in the main DC storyline like Superman Prime) but chose to reduce himself to our level, we humans, because he believes that he does is the right thing.

There are obvious similarities here with Christianity and American idealism.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end, the iconography of Superman is the representation of genuine and just protection from any harm. In short, he is truly meant to be an icon of hope, justice and the American way even if he is a classic hero.

However, I feel that the iconography of Superman has been changed into just simply portraying him as perfect but he is never focused on what he represents even if he is considered as boring because in the end, he is meant to give a feeling of hope that everyone he encounters, no matter how hard their day was or what the person was going through.

We tend to see Superman being portrayed in a manner where we are provoked to question his principles and actions as someone with all that power, a God amongst us humans, may be provoked to think otherwise that he would deem as just - such as in The Dark Knight Returns storyline, in the Red Sun comic and in the Injustice arc.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, Batman is almost an anti-hero version of Superman where his idea of justice is more blurry as he can sometimes jump between vengeance and justice, or between going by the book or vigilantism or a necessary evil.

However, it seems that Batman, being the most popular superhero, is implemented in almost every storyline possible, even in stories where he is out of place such as in the Justice League Dark film, and where he is portrayed as a person who is almost perfect and just in every way, almost like a super-righteous knight.

The most common example that comes to mind is how Batman seems to have been ""fanboy""-ied into being the kind of hero that can anyone with preparation and resources, no matter how powerful or smart or numerous his opponents are.

Or that no matter what Batman thinks or does, no matter how dark his thoughts may be or how brutal or shocking his methods are, he is considered as always the right and the hero of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

However, being that Batman is meant to be a human being who has limits in terms of power when compared to meta beings, he is meant to represent to flaw nature of humanity - our way of thinking, and our way of life, as Batman was raised in human culture and is most familiar with the shockingly brutal reality of Gotham and Arkham.

But even though Batman is meant to be a human being and even if he is identified as a genius and implements logic in his methods and principles such as in his ""no-killing"" rule and is very aware of himself, I do not think that we often see Batman being placed in positions where he is provoked to question my morals, principles or even his sanity considering how blurry and conveniently human they are (at least, not in mainstream media).

We managed to have storylines where Batman was provoked to be in this position a couple of times such as in the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, in the Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth story, in the Long Halloween storyline, or in The Joker: Devil's Advocate story, or one instance in the Killing Joke, 

But it seems that every time the Dark Knight is portrayed, at least in most mainstream media, Batman is worshipped in almost every way and that no matter what his actions and ideas are, he is always the hero - in the Lego Batman film is where we find this most prominently where his hero worship was used as the main driving humour of the story.

It is as though Batman is impervious to criticism and he is always the hero in the end - no matter if he was the extreme rebel in the Red Son story, or the brutal and narcissistic person in the All-Star storyline and in the Dark Knight Returns, or how thorough and defensive he was in the Tower of Babel story where he made contingency plans for every Justice League member without their knowledge, or no matter what parenting style he uses to the Robin family (usually done in a very disciplinary manner which the Red Hood sometimes uses as an excuse for his anger towards Batman)

&amp;#x200B;

It feels ironic that these beings are portrayed in almost opposite ways than what they are meant to be where Batman is meant human at his core and being human means being flawed, while Superman is meant to be perfect but meant to be a representation of an ideal despite his almost omnipotent existence",DCcomics

Sorry to ask this, at the risk of seeming dumb, but the app feels really unintuitive to use in certain ways and so I was hoping someone could help.

I'm trying to read collected storylines from their own suggested storylines, but I'm having a problem with getting the comics to keep loading in reading order.

For instance, if there's a storyline which spans over multiple series, let's say for simplicity the story order is;

Batman 1, Batman 2, JLA 1, Batman 3, JLA 2, Robin 1, Batman 4

when I select the storyline in question, it shows all the various books initially, but when I start to read, I'll get through Batman 1 and 2 ok, but when I hit ""read next"" from Batman 2, it jumps right to Batman 3, rather than JLA 1, if that makes sense?

Is there a way to do this that actually follows the reading order when hitting ""read next"" rather than the issue order of the current series?

1655695766,beary_good,July 2022 Book Club Nomination - Original Graphic Novels,"Here, we'll vote for the book to be featured in the July Book Club. You may nominate or upvote books that you wish to discuss. **Do not nominate more than one book, and do not post a duplicate nomination.**    

Like with our Character of the Month polls, each poll will have a particular theme or category. This week's category is: **Original Graphic Novels**. Nominate stories that were published not as serialized comic issues, but directly as full-length graphic novels. They may be original graphic novels, or extended one-shots that are collected and published by themselves as standalone books.

Guidelines for book eligibility are as follows:  

- The book must be widely available in-print. This means that I should be able to go to an online retailer like Amazon, InStockTrades, or Book Depository and buy it without paying an exorbitant markup. 

- The book must be available digitally (ie, Comixology, DC Universe, or Hoopla Digital), either as a complete collection or individual issues. It must be available through **legal means**; do not post a piracy site.  
- The book should be reasonably affordable. Paperback trades, hardcovers, and Deluxe Editions are fine. Absolutes and Omnibuses are not.  
- If you're nominating a story arc, be sure to include the trade where it's collected. Do not nominate a single issue or Annual.  
- Limit your nomination to a single collection or graphic novel. Don't just nominate an entire run; pick out one particular volume. Under certain circumstances, we may allow two volumes from a single creative run to be nominated, if they're reasonably short and tell a complete story (e.g., a 12-issue mini-series split up into two trades). However, this is left to moderator discretion.  
- Anything published by DC is eligible. That includes main-line comics, graphic novels, imprints (such as Vertigo), media tie-ins, and others.  
- Only nominate a book if you're genuinely interested in reading and discussing it. There's no prize for picking the most popular answer.

1655686870,Dat1DudeAge14,Is Intergang just the Mafia but armed with alien weaponry?,"I'm curious about where Intergang stands in the criminal underworld of the DC universe.  I've read online that they were formed in the 1920's and became the most powerful crime cartel in Metropolis.  But Tobias Whale and the 100(with the backing of Lex Luthor) took complete control of the Metropolis drug trade, forcing Bruno Mannheim into a truce that limited Intergang to weapons trafficking.  

Anyway, Intergang seems to be structured like a traditional Mafia family.  A lot of their members seem to wear classic gangster attire like old school Mafiosi, but they also have alien armors and advanced weapons.  Also, more realistic Mafia organizations like the Falcone crime family exist in the DC universe. 

So, basically, I'm wondering if Intergang maybe started out as a fictionalized version of the Mafia.  What do you all think?",DCcomics

They really highlight her worst traits when it comes to him.

She also cheated on him with freakin Bruce and got mad at him for being non consensually kissed by Tarantula and broke up with him for it.

Now onto him, they are willing to destroy essential parts of him just to have him with her, having him cheat on Kory before their wedding (even though I’m like 90% sure he was still under brother Bloods control) they also have a habit of making his skills less to make her look good.

Don’t get me started on how she handled the whole Ric Grayson arc it’s no wonder he didn’t want anything to do with her or the other Batfam with how she treated him when he didn’t remember her. 
Or how when she was 20 she kissed him despite him still being 14 which is gross.

It was frustrating always feeling like I was missing context and background and so I began researching various reading orders. I eventually stumbled on mikesamazingworld.com 

They have a catalogue of every DC book released and their covers. I decided I would start at Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there. I read through the DC infinite compilation and then plugged in the date at the end to mikes(somewhere around 1986, too lazy to check forgive me) and sorted by publication date.

I read about 15-20 of the titles from each month skipping ones that arent on the app or that dont really interest me. Ill read one, go back to the mikes page and find the next. Im at the tale end of 1988 and having a great time reading some lesser known runs or old classics Ive missed. 

Its a big undertaking but I have enjoyed myself immensely and reccomend this to anyone looking for a big project.

She has some kind of slowed aging or immortality, so she could seemingly be 25, 52, or any age.

In Secret Six Vol 3 29, we learn that the New Earth version of the character was born and raised in Brazil to an unnamed Brazilian woman. Vandal attempted a coup, but was foiled by the military. There are not many clues to the time of these events, though her mother is seen holding a knife that looks rather modern (post WW2 at least, I'd say). Vandal is wearing a frilly shirt, but that is his thing. I'd even be happy with a reference that was vague, like the events happened 50 years ago or something. The DC Continuity Project has her being born ""48 years ago,"" but I am not sure if that is based on anything.

And she was leader of the team in Justice League vs Teen Titans, and she seemed to do a good job in that.

I don’t read a lot of comics, so I’m not sure about her leadership status in the comics.

In conclusion, I think Starfire has what it takes to be a leader. She’s emotionally mature, she’s strong enough to protect people, and she’s almost like a big sister, and mother figure of the group.

**Superman #8**

**Story 1**

Two scientist have discovered a method of making creatures gigantic.  So what are they going to do now?  Naturally, they're going to turn humans into giant to take over the world!  Said giant humans begin terrorizing the countryside, getting the attention of the Daily Planet, who send both Lois and Clark.  Clark however, decides to ditch her and go as Superman.  He flies over and sees massive the massive humans building homes on a mountain.  Meanwhile, at the governor's mansion, a giant breaks in and kidnaps both him and his daughter (feels like he should have known about the giants????).  Superman attempts to sneak into the extinct volcano where the giants have made their home, but a massive siren emits a message, saying if he if wanted to continue his ""altruistic existence"" (HAHA!  Since when?) he should back off.  Superman rebuffs this, but is attacked by one of the giants.  Superman however, flies down and breaks his toe, causing the giant to hop around.  More giants come running, so Superman triggers an avalanche.  While everything is coming down, one of the giants grabs him and gets buried under snow.  The scientist declares the death of Superman (come guys, really?).  Right at the moment, however, Lois is flying over in a plane, get grabbed by one of the giants and kidnapped.  Superman breaks out of the ice.  Superman attempts to break into the lab, but is caught by a giant once again.  The scientists offer to let Superman join them, but he rebuffs them and they begin turning both Lois and the governor's daughters into giants.  Superman decides to heck with all of this, escapes the giant, grabs a BIG ROCK, and slams it into the top of the volcano and SETS IT OFF.  As all the glaciers melt and the mountain floods, the giants panic and try to run away, crushing the scientists.  Superman breaks back into the lab, smashes the glass between himself and the kidnapped women, and discovers that it was a trick, and the women are fine.  He then grabs everyone and flies away while the giants are buried and killed by the avalanche.

You know what, kudos to Superman.  I was genuinely entertained by this comic and not just in an ironic way.  It's probably because these giants are the first real threat to Superman since the comic began.  I know they're working their way up to giving him real villains and not just ones he breaks into twigs any time they anger him.  It was nice to see hints of it, and I look forward to seeing more.  It also helps that this was what I thought comics were going to be like before I started and not just, you know, Superman being a menace to society by destroying Metropolis and fighting the national guard.  And just to add on, SUPERMAN CAUSED A VOLCANO TO ERUPT.  For corn's sake Superman, you have no idea how much damage that would cause!  It could Mt. St. Helens or Krakatoa all over again!  But oh no!  Let's just DESTROY A MOUNTAIN TO SAVE THREE PEOPLE.  God I love this man.

**Story 2**

Clark is being spied upon through his apartment window, but before he can deal with that, an old friend who is ""connected with anti-espionage service"" knocks on his door.  He tells Clark that a dangerous spy is coming to Metropolis by boat and he wants Clark to investigate.  Clark to decides to go as Superman and flies to the port.  The spy sent to coordinate attacks on the USA is named Eric Reibel (COME ON GUYS!  FOR REAL?).  He tries to get his men to spread dangerous leaflets while  striking a um...Notzi pose, only for Superman to break in and destroy the leaflets.  They try to beat him and you can bet how that goes.  Superman then GRABS A GUN AND SHOOTS THE REIBEL GUY, although he manages to jump in front of the bullet and stops it, threatening that if he doesn't stop he'll let it hit him.  Clark attempts to go meet his old friend, but he hears a shot outside of his office.  I turns out, the man that had been watching him was his friend's assistant and has killed his employer.  Just as the cops arrive, however, the killer throws the gun to Clark (who catches it like an idiot) and the assistant blames him.  They find in Clark's pocket a list of the spies and saboteurs and they arrest him.  Clark escapes and returns as Superman as starts following Reibel.  He and the spy end up in an isolated place in some mountains where Superman discovers them gathering and training an army to attack the US.  There, the leader who is not at all drawn like a stereotypical Notzi, says that the assistant that framed Clark is now one of their agents in the Anti-Espionage Service.  Naturally, Superman sneaks into the tent and breaks into the safe to get the documents.  A soldier tries to bayonette him, and Superman wraps the gun around his body to tie him up (AWESOME).  The whole camp is then scrambled where Superman fights through men, planes, and artillery.  He then flies over their munitions plant, and contemplates not attacking it would kill everyone.  Fortunately for that moral conundrum (and the Golden Age kill count), a stray shell whizzes by him and suddenly forgetting he has super speed, he allows it to hit the munitions plant and explode, killing everyone.  Turning back to Clark, he returns to Metropolis and KIDNAPS THE ASSISTANT AT GUNPOINT.  He takes him back to the Daily Planet where he gets the man to confess, but Lois points out that a coerced confession won't stand up.  Clark, however, hands over the document from the Notzi camp, showing the assistant's involvement.  The man is arrested and all is well.

At least Superman isn't fight the United States armed forced this time!  Actual panels of action seem to be surprisingly rare in early Superman, all things considered.  Showing him causing wonton destruction to people he should be is actually quite satisfying.  I just hope he sticks with the um...uh...Notzis and not America.  Then again, he's already caused millions of dollars worth of damage to America, so why stop now?  Also, I didn't think they were ever going to address this, but since Lois brought it up: yeah, how do ANY of the confessions Superman gets admissible and not under duress?  He basically takes a criminal, throws him around a bit, and then threatens to kill them to get a confession.  Anything they say to the police would be thrown out because Superman threatened them to get it.  I wasn't going to say anything because, you know, ""comic book logic LOL!"" but THEY were the ones to bring it up!  Way to poke holes in your own mythology guys!

Story 3

Clark has taken Lois to a carnival where they are actually having a good time.  One of the carnival barkers, however, ropes Clark into playing a rigged game.  After a while, Clark tries to quit, but they force him to pay eight dollars.  Playing the weenie, Clark pays and Lois is disgusted.   Lois decides to run an expose on those guys because I guess all the spies and giants are defeated so we need to go after carnival barkers!  Clark says not to do it, but decides Superman should handle these...two-bit hucksters, I guess?  Lois catches proof, but gets caught and they destroy her camera.  She goes to the owner of the carnival who acts out firing the guys, but secretly he's in on too.  The carnival workers later corner a guy who wouldn't pay up and start beating him, but Superman swoops in.  They try to stab him , but Superman TAKES THE KNIFE AND EATS IT (THAT WAS COOL).  He beats them up and sticks their heads through one of those ball-throwing boards and then throws baseballs at them like a psychopath.  He then tosses them around, digs underground around them, and even decides to let them beat on him for a while.  Lois shows up and is grabbed by one of them, Superman decides he's had enough.  He then beats them up to get confessions (which the last comic established are inadmissible) and Lois gets a policeman to arrest them.  Upon realizing the jig is up, the carnival owner attempts to flee, but Superman chases him down in his car (by ripping open the canopy which is awesome, and drags him back to the police.  He then shows the cops that the owner has been stealing valuables from people at the carnival.  The story ends with Superman telling the audience to always be on the lookout for unscrupulous characters at places like carnivals.

\*Deep breath\* I'm going to give this story A LOT of latitude and say it was meant to be a lesson for the kids not to waste their money at carnival games.  A sort of ""Superman Says"" segment where he tries to teach all the youngsters not to fall for these sorts of things.  Otherwise I'd explode at how much a massive step down we've had in the level of crime that Superman decides is worthy of his time.  He goes from giants trying to destroy the world to a local two-bit manure salesman making a couple dimes off of idiots at the carnival.  IT'S FOR THE KIDS.  FOR THE KIDS.  TEACHING THE KIDS. DON'T LOSE IT.  Okay kids, don't play those carnival games.  They're rigged.  Let's move on.",DCcomics

1655516490,JosephMeach,Y'all got any of that...Clark Kent Superboy Chronology?,"Hey people, I have been collecting Superboy back issues (and the small number of reprints that exist) lately, and I had a question for people who are maybe not new at this:  


\- After the More Fun Comics run, in Adventure Comics #103 (1946) it is Clark's 10th birthday.

\- In the earliest issues of Superboy that I have (early 1950s) he attends Smallville High School, goes on dates, etc.

\- In The New Adventures of Superboy #1 (1980) it is his 16th birthday. Right before that, in Superboy/Legion #258-259, he leaves the Legion in order to not learn too much about his own future. 

\- In Superman: The Secret Years (1985) he transitions from Superboy to Superman, during college.  


So my question is, do all of the Legion adventures happen before his 16th birthday, or is the New Adventures of Superboy (I haven't read it yet) modern retellings of stuff from Volume 1? Has anyone put together a Superboy chronology that might include Adventure Comics?  


Thanks!",DCcomics

1655476931,DasEmperor,It's 2022. Here's what I think of the Justice League cast.,"Not Justice League the movie, Justice League the cast. Also this doesn't include Zachary Levi as Shazam even though he was incredible in Shazam, nor does it include Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, even though she was incredible in that role. This is just the Justice League members.

**Henry Cavill as Superman**

This one's a bummer for me because you have a giant nerd playing a giant jock. Henry Cavill was built to play Batman but he signed on as Superman and played it as Batman-like as possible, and part of that's Zach Snider being emo and trying to subvert the character, eventually coming up with something that is equidistant from the comics and Brightburn, but still. Superman's the kind of guy who simultaneously wants to save the world, and help an old lady across the street. Henry Cavill's superman wanted to... make out with Lois Lane, and help his mom from a distance. He's not personable, and he lives in an isolated awkward bubble with few people who can get close. 

In conclusion, I think a reboot here would do the character some good.

**Ben Afflek as Batman**

Might as well be Henry Cavill playing both roles, honestly. This Batman is violent and stoic, and has the bonus of tossing out every possible memorable Batman moment and skipping right to the end. At least Henry Cavill's Superman had the distinction of being allowed to have relationships. Seriously the most personable thing this iteration does is save Harley in Suicide Squad after he punches her in the face. Batman's not a loner. He's the kind of weirdo that adopts an orphan because said orphan stole his hubcaps, and another one who tried to murder him. He's got some dad energy and I don't think Ben Afflek (or possibly the sort of middle ground scripts that he got) allowed him to play the role of a guy who honestly wants the best for the next generation.

**Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman**

Honest to goodness I hope Gal Gadot is still playing Wonder Woman at like 80 years old. I went back and watched some of the old Lynda Carter Wonder Woman show, and it's good, but I retroactively see Gal Gadot as the correct Wonder Woman choice. 

**Jason Mamoa as Aquaman**

The best part of the Aquaman movie was definitely Aquaman himself. I like the interpretation of Aquaman as the big, aggressive seeming dudebro, and I think Jason Mamoa really plays it up so well. My favorite part of the whole movie was that scene at the beginning in the bar, when him and these bikers look like they're sizing each other up, then wind up on a wild night of drinking and laughing. Absolute gold. Jason Mamoa is going to be tough to replace.

**Ezra Miller as the Flash**

Ezra Miller has this kind of nervous energy that works for the role... but it also works for someone who took a lot of drugs and groomed children. Since apparently the second one seems to be true, that's literally all I can see now, and I think they could replace him with any given skinny guy and have an equally valid Flash. I don't think Evan Peters is doing anything right now. He was a good Quicksilver. Why not Flash?

**Ray Fisher as Cyborg**

He's... stoic. I don't really have a whole lot of positive or negative stuff to say about the guy. He played the character. He did it. He said all the lines and was in the places he needed to be, but if they pulled a War Machine on him, I wouldn't feel anything in particular about it. I think if the dude gets a movie, he's going to need to get a writer who's very different from Zach Snider and Joss Whedon, who's able to humanize an actor a lot more. I think Ray Fisher's personality gets washed out in the big action packed fight scenes in a way that the other actors don't, but also it's hard to find other stuff with him in it, since he's a pretty new actor. He might still be trying to figure himself out. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that he seems a lot more robotic than I expected from a character literally called Cyborg.

**Conclusion**

I have nothing against any of these actors, except maybe Ezra Miller after the allegations. That being said, I think Gal Gadot and Jason Mamoa are the absolute keepers, and the rest could theoretically be replaced. We're getting a new Batman, who knows about Superman, Flash, and Cyborg, but I do think jumping into a high stakes movie with the strongest heroes was a bit too soon. Marvel jumped into the Avengers with 4 of the 6 having gotten their own movie (the other two appearing in other movies) and the villain having appeared as a villain in a previous film. It's not like Joss Whedon suddenly forgot how to make a successful superhero movie, it's more that Joss Whedon was given a setup for 2012's Avengers that is not hard to succeed with. 

So yeah. I think anything else Justice League is too soon. I think we need an upbeat non-emo Superman, a Batman who can hold down relationships (but not romance), a Flash who acts heroic, and a Cyborg who gets excited about things happening.

This has been an opinion, not an absolute fact, thank you for reading this entire diatribe. Very generous of you.",DCcomics

As for Dark Nights I think I understand most of it that every universe became validated, and it seems to connect with the 3 Crisis stories. Does it have any connection to Doomsday Clock or is it pretty unrelated? Does it connect to Flashpoint?

Also does Darkseid War contain anything important here?

* [**Fatale**](https://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fatale_001_5th.jpg), by Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips 

When discussing crime fiction comics, it’s impossible to not bring up the all-star creative team of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. Fatale is no different as the duo effortlessly craft a story with hardboiled detective overtones, combined with otherworldly and supernatural elements of Lovecraftian horror. The narrative takes the classic film noir trope of the femme fatale, and reworks it to be at the forefront of a dark mystery involving violence, cults, and tentacle monsters.

So, what are *you* reading?

1655389742,blue490246,Exclusive variant covers going against Pride initiatives?,"Just a note before getting into my thoughts here - I don't usually write these opinion-based posts and my point is not to sway anyone's opinions on sexuality, so I apologize if I offend anyone in advance - that is not my intention.

\-------

After seeing the 18th retailer exclusive variant cover for the Poison Ivy mini-series that just came out earlier this month, I started to get a sense of maybe how ironic it was that we've got all these Pride-based books promoting LGBTQIA+ and the only Pride-based book getting retailer variants is Poison Ivy. Goes to show where the market is at from a sexuality perspective? (i.e. heterosexual men with a secondary audience of anyone else who sexually prefers women)

We didn't get any retailer variants for the Pride 2022 collection nor the Tim Drake Special that just came out this week, and I'd argue the stories in each of those books were just as great to read. To try to be mildly objective, I wouldn't think Poison Ivy (and Harley Quinn) are more popular than the sum of all the characters shown in the Pride 2022 collection combined? 

Does this suggest that the Pride books don't sell? Or are retailers who pitch for exclusives not into the Pride scene and even, dare I say, homophobic? Or is DC holding back on retailers making exclusive covers for Pride-based books this month (with clear exception to Poison Ivy...)? It just seems ironic that there's this big Pride agenda from DC/Marvel/other publishers and retailers don't seem to be making an effort to promote that? Retailer exclusive variants are usually an indication of which books are expected to sell, at least based on the assumption that retailers have purposely invested in exclusive cover artwork to sell a unique version of the book, so the decision to offer an exclusive cover is calculated to some degree.",DCcomics

Movies are hit or miss, actors make scandals, Batman is the only character that gets decent content etc. We have dozens of different problems. If we had a decent movie universe by now, we'd probably have gotten past most of these problems by now. 

Batman continues to get content because his movies are so good and so loved. In a successful cinematic universe, you can make popular characters out of Spider-Man, just like in Marvel. That's not the only problem, TV shows like Doom Patrol or Stargirl don't get the attention they deserve because of low brand recognition or not being connected to a larger universe.

 For example everyone is talking about Marvel's Ms.Marvel right now, but DC has already done better with Stargirl!!?? It's just that nobody saw it!!??? Yes, that's what I'm going to say, what do you think?

**Superman #7**

**Story 4**

The cover of this story has man being shot while striking a ballerina-like pose, just thought I would put that out there.  Apparently a gang called the Black Gang (IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK) has been terrorizing the city.  A reporter from a rival newspaper named Peter Peeker (oh for the love of...!)  has been getting the scoop on them.  Naturally, the editor of the Daily Planet says Lois and Clark needs to get a scoop on them or they're fired, like a good boss would do.  So Lois and Clark decide to go undercover as socialites to a local night club where the Black Gang strikes.  Lois dyes her hair blonde and Clark takes off his glasses, although Lois still doesn't recognize him as Superman (great reporter she is!)  At the club, Lois makes Clark shell out money like it's going out of style to draw attention to themselves.  They attract the attention of Peter Peeker (DON'T DO IT!  DON'T MAKE THE JOKE.  YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS).  Believing him to be rich. a woman spends time time with Clark, and eventually asks him to take her home.  On the way, the car is ambushed by the black gang (BECAUSE OF THE BLACK HOODS), but Clark flees and quickly changes into Superman.  Peter Peeker (JUST GONNA CLENCH MY TEETH)  offers to drive Lois to a better club, but instead drives them to the Black Gang's hideout, showing he was working for them.  They find out who Lois is, attempt to kill her, and Superman busts in to stop them.  He then ""makes them dance"" by throwing bullets at their feet like the great guy he is before tying them up and calling the police.  Clark and Lois then write up the story about the dirty reporter.

WHEW!  The names they pick for people.  I already had one meltdown over GAY CITY (HAHAHAHAHAHA!) we don't need another one.  I'm really beginning to wonder why Clark has such a thing for Lois.  They go to the club because it was her idea and then she makes him hemorrhage money just to get attention.  He even gave out a $20 bill, which in today's money would be $787! (Shut-up!  Don't question my math!) He's said numerous times that he likes that Lois sticking her nose into things and getting into trouble, but at the same time she's NEVER nice to him because she thinks he's a weenie.  However, he acts like a weenie to keep her from thinking he's Superman.  This brings up two possibilities: one, he could not work for the Daily Planet so she would never think that, or two, he could just date her as Superman.  Then again, logic was never the strong suit for Mr. Let's-destroy-a-section-of-Metropolis-that's-poor man!

**Action Comics #30, Cover date: November 1940**

It's summer in Metropolis, but the city is covered by a blizzard!  Clark goes to interview the weatherman, but he has no explanation.  Suddenly, a woman over the radio says she has information on why it's frozen over and will only tell it to Superman.  Clark is sent to the location with Lois butting in and deciding to scoop the story.  A woman arrives along with a blonde companion at the metting site.  A car pulls up full with...uh...let's say um...less than flattering drawings of Arabic people?  Abruptly they fire a mechanism at her that launches a glowing ball of light.  When it hits her, she disentigrates!  A policeman comes running, but they shoot and dissolve him too!  Then Lois arrives, and finally Superman swoops in and rescues her.  The, let's say Middle-Eastern men then grab the blonde woman that had come originally and threaten to kill her.  Superman, apparently forgetting he has super speed, grabs Lois and bounds away.  We then briefly cut to to the Sahara desert where a man named Carlton Vogel has found the lost city of Ulonda, before he can celebrate, men come by on horses, firing those balls of light and disintegrating them.  The men who attack say their leader is Zolar.  Back in the present, the Middle-Eastern gentlemen attempt to get the blonde woman into a rocket.  They fire that globe thing at Superman, but it only knocks him unconscious, so they take him too.  Later, he wakes up to find he and the blonde woman are chained up.  It turns out, she's Laura Vogel, brother of the guy who found the city and they are looking for a guy named Zolar.  Apparently Zolar has great stores of radium which apparently powers his ray gun and weather controlling machines.  Laura then gives a bizarre reason for the snowfall, in that Zolar's people said she had until the first snowfall in Metropolis to tell them where the lost city was, and then made it snow???  Moving on...Zolar then appears in a screen with his GIANT FACE, but despite the fact that he's a bald mad scientist, he is NOT in fact, Lex Luthor.  They then arrive at Zolar's fortress where Superman goes crazy and starts wrecking stuff.  To get him to stop, Zolar starts dropping glowing orbs on Ulonda,  Superman, leaps onto Zolar's rocket and demands Zolar order HIS SHIPS TO CRASH WITH THE PEOPLE ON IT.  ZOLAR COMPLIES AND ALL OF HIS SHIPS CRASH TO THE GROUND (OH MY FREAKIN' GOD!!!!).  It is then revealed that Laura is in fact working for Zolar, and the first woman that had been vaporized was originally Luara.  She launches one of the orbs at Superman, but, again, it only knocks Superman out.  It then bounces back and hits Zolar and the woman, vaporizing them both.  Superman wakes up and returns to Metrolopis where the weather has returned to normal.

OKAY!  OKAY!  SUPERMAN STRAIGHT UP KILLED PEOPLE!  THIS ISN'T LIKE ""OH A RICHOCHET BOUNCED OFF AND HIT THE BAD GUY.""  NO!  HE ORDERED A GUY TO TO CRASH HIS ROCKETS FULL OF PEOPLE AND THEN THE EVIL GENIUS JUST...DOES IT?????  WHAT IN THE MADNESS OF CORN COB IS THIS?  DID NO ONE BRING THIS UP IN THE WRITING ROOM?  I can't even add to the Golden Age kill count because there's no telling how many people Superman killed!  That was a monstrous thing to do!  And the fact that the bad guy was just like ""OKAY!"" like Superman would just let him get away after that?  Also, logic didn't exactly prevail in this issue did it?  I get that the blonde woman wasn't really Laura, but the story about the first snowfall was kinda...dumb?  They didn't have to freeze Metropolis, they could have just put a gun to Laura's head and make her talk.  There was no reason to do winter in July just to draw attention to yourself!  Also also, and I don't want to harp on this point too much, but the Arabic people have like...green skin for some reason???  Like, I can't tell if that's racist or like a color error?  This was one bonkers, violent, nonsensical Superman comic and I can't even comprehend how they thought it would work!

More of this please.  I NEED THIS.  INJECT IT DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS.

**Action Comics #31, Cover date: December 1940**

Clark and Lois are on vacation together (but apparently not as a couple, I guess?) and they decide to go to the small town of Brentville to relax.  When they get there, however, everyone in the twon is dead asleep, and Lois follows soon after.  Clark goes to a fire station where they apparently have gas masks and puts them on himself and Lois.  He then drives to the edge of town where the gas (he never got confirmation it was gas???) might be lighter.  He finds a house and tries to use the telephone of a professor.  The professor's assistant, however, attempts to hit Clark over the head with a wrench, which obviously doesn't work.  Lois wakes up, but she and Clark spot a car full of people in gas masks driving down the street.  They tail it to find they are breaking into a bank.  Lois rushes in, but they take her mask off and she drops unconscious.  This allows Clark to change into Superman.  He beats them up and takes off their masks, dropping them like flies.  More people come to investigate the town, but all keep falling asleep on the street.  The police arrive in gas masks, and find Lois and Clark.  They accuse them of being a part of this, but Clark says he was the one that phoned them and to go check with the professor.  Only the assistant is there, and he calls Clark a liar, getting them both arrested and locked in a room.  Clark knocks out Lois with a nerve pinch and turns into Superman.  It turns out, someone is filling the room with Hydrocyanic Acid.  He breaks out and carries Lois away.  When Superman returns, he discovers that the assistant has been working with a foreign agent to get the sleeping gas for his country.  The gangster who were trying to rob the bank worked for the assistant and weren't part of the original plan.  Superman decides to dig under the house and create a tunnel from the outside (I mean...okay?) and finds the professor in the cellar.  Superman escape with him, but returns to find that the foreign agent, now named Munsdorf, and the assistant have come to the cellar.  Seeing that the professor has escaped, the agent shoots the assistant.  Munsdorf whips out a ""ultra-modern atomic gun"" and shoot him.  It doesn't affect Superman, so Munsdorf then fires it at a nearby house where Lois just so happens to be.  Superman rushes to save her, but when he returns Munsdorf is attacking the professor.  Superman blocks the ray and in a confusing panel either it ricochets back and kills him or Superman touched the man and he died.  Either way: Golden Age Superman Kill Count: 13.  Clark wants to continue with the vacation after that, but Lois wants to rush back to Metropolis for the story.

Another day, another kill for our beloved hero!  Sometimes they try to make it not Superman's fault, and other times he's just a merciless killer annihilating people on a whim.  The hero of the people, am I right?  This is the second comic in a short time that involves a poison gas that kills people, but with war looming I guess they're trying to reference the last big war, WWI, and the gas attacks.  That being said, there were suddenly a lot of gas masks in this story.  Did firemen and cops in 1940 have gas masks so easily on hand?  I know that now they do, but it feels like that wouldn't be a thing quite yet.   Also, Lois literally ran towards an explosion in a town full of poison gas.  Not the sharpest reporter in the newsroom is she?  Also also, were Clark and Lois going on a country getaway to bang?  I mean, it's 1940 and this is for kids, so I don't think that was the implication, but in 2022 it certainly SOUNDS like they were going to.  I mean why else go to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere?  What are they going to do there?  READ?  But no, Clark had to be jock-blocked by a plot to steal poison gas for a foreign nation!  If I had a nickel every time that happened in a Superman comic I'd have a dime!  Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice.",DCcomics
1655341866,inklingboi08,Why is the DC Multiverse so not connected?,"What I mean is that, in the Marvel multiverse, no one universe has the same designation (aside from MoM calling the MCU Earth-616 because I'm convinced the writers don't actually read comics. So does the actress for Kamala Khan, look it up). It's one whole multiverse with each timeline and adaptation being different universes. And yes, the multiverse has been rewritten, just like DC has the crisis events. But in DC, you have multiple Earth-1's, etc. And by my understanding the multiverse only has 52 universes but also doesn't? It's considered that it's all one multiverse but not designated as such. It's honestly just confusing and it's one of my barriers for entry into DC after being a Marvel fan for almost my whole life.",DCcomics

I was hoping see if anyone knew a good list / website that shows what DC graphic novels / compilation books / comic runs have been released when etc.  For the last decade or so, I seem to basically let 2-3 years worth of content pile up, then order a million ""volume compilations"" from the library and catch up.  Not sure why, just works out that way..  :)  

I keep a list of what issue the volume compilations ended on, so I end up with a list like this (only much longer):

Justice League 	43  
Justice League Dark	19  
Justice League Odyssey	18

I feel like I'm probably caught up to 2019-2020 depending on the title...  But I'm finding the recent releases don't seem as interested in maintaining the ""Batman vol 7"", ""Batman vol 8"" format, and tend to shunt individual story/titles into like story compilations, which is making it harder to build a ""shopping list"" for the library, and pick up where I left off.

Superman has arrived and he’s out of sight! Right? The world may love him, but the citizens of Metropolis are growing skeptical as the cities around them suffer without the help of the Man of Steel. The world doesn’t need saving as much as it needs changing, and Superman and his super friends in the Justice League seem unqualified to save the day the way they once did. Could this be the beginning of the end that Pariah prophesied? Or is it just a sign of the times?

1655304124,greppoboy,do you guys think that dc will ever do a crisis on infinity earths in movie form?," 

Seeing how dc is picking things from past movies and retcon them into the dceu and at the same time doing many stories that take place in other universes across cinema, tv and streaming, so they are in a very similar situation as dc comics was in the early 80s, with lots of different content in diffetent universes and a bagage of old, not anymore running, content.

So in the case that all of these stuff creates so mutch confusion that it hurts the brand do you think they will do a massive events that involves all the movies and tv shows (dceu, joker, the batman, cw, and even older movies as we have seen with keaton they don't care if something is not currently running or treanding) like crisis on infinite earths was, and after doing this epic multiversal stories the end product will be a single, cohesive, earth 1, with only the favourite parts from all dc live action in this earth, with a shared past, and also little things they want to expand on?

I'm not saying this is a bad idea or good, just asking because i love the comic and i see that dc is already keen to use the multiverse to change the status quo to avoid brand controversy or confusion, so, regardless of story potential or repsect of the autor, i think that if all of this many universes many stories will start to fail they will take the best stuff and take away the worst, or what they think it is, and if they do i hope they adapt this realy fun story",DCcomics

He was able to hold his own against Midnighter who literally is able to tell what his opponent is going to do because he “fights like Jazz”

He has pulled a Batman on Batman

1655256615,Some-Dog9800,Day two of making my way down this subreddit's recommended comics list: Batgirl - Year One,"Hi, yesterday I started a series where I go down this subreddit's [list of recommended comics for newbies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended/newbies) and review one item each day. Yesterday's entry was about Aquaman Volume 1 - The Trench by Geoff Johns. You can read that entry [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended/newbies). Today's item was Batgirl - Year One by Chuck Dixon and Scott Beatty. It tells the story of Barbara's journey to becoming Batgirl.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I haven't read Batgirl as much as I've read Batman but I tend to really enjoy the Batgirl books I do read (except whatever the fuck that new Birds of Prey run was), and this was no exception (unlike THAT FUCKING BOP RUN). I really love her character and I find the whole concept behind Barbara super interesting. I like the way her relationship with Robin is depicted (I'm a DickBabs shipper, fight me), and I loved how Barbara developed over the course of this story. I particularly loved Dixon and Beatty's portrayal of Killer Moth, they made him come off sort of pathetic and down on his luck like an alchoholic Spider-Man dressed like a Beetle. I was kind of rooting for him at times. Firefly came off really menacing and unhinged which played well with Killer Moth's characterization. It seems like the new Batgirl movie will be borrowing elements from this run with Killer Moth and everything which just makes me even more excited. 

One thing I felt was a bit unnecessary was Black Canary's inclusion. She just kind of popped up and disappeared a few panels. At this point in the DC chronology, I don't know that Batman and the Justice League would even have a Watchtower yet, but maybe that's just my dumb headcanon getting in the way.

Make sure to leave your thoughts on this comic down below. I'll probably skip Hush since I've already read it about three times. So tomorrow's entry will be Batman: Year One.",DCcomics

1655244871,nightwing612,Chris Jones and Greg Weisman answer fan questions on DCUI Forums to celebrate the release of Young Justice: Targets,"&amp;#x200B;

    Q1: will we see the Penguin on Young Justice? I’m a huge fan of the character and would love to see him on the show.:smiley:

GW: I’m afraid my answer to this - as to most of these kinds of questions - is NO SPOILERS. But we did MENTION Penguin in Phantoms. So at least you know an Earth-16 version of ol’ Oswald exists. 

    Q2: Who will be in the team? Will Greta Hayes be in it — asking for a friend :eyes:

GW: Targets takes place only a month after Phantoms! The roster of the Team will not have changed. 

    Q3: I was curious if this was an idea that got left out of the current season or a new idea that came about after the season was written. I love this show and hope for another season or at least more comic series.

GW: These are ideas which Brandon Vietti and I have had for some time…We’re finally getting around to “portraying” them in Targets. 

    Q4: I love that characters that first appeared in the original YJ tie-in comic series a decade ago like Wyynde, King Sha’ark, Blubber got to eventually show up in animation in YJ Seasons 3 and 4.
    
    Is YJ: Targets introducing any new characters that Chris got to design/draw that we may see again down the line in the animated series?

GW: YES!

CJ: Obviously that would be dependent on their being future seasons to appear in (#SaveEarth16), but we’ve already had characters from the previous tie-in comics make their way into the TV show, so it could certainly happen again! 

    Q5: Hey Greg and Chris, thanks for coming back! That was a really phenomenal season finale we just watched. I’ve got one question though – how were Zod and the other Phantom Zoners instantly able to address Metropolis in English when they emerged from the Boom Tube? Thanks!

GW: Ma’alefa’ak downloaded English to their minds!

    Q6: From what I’ve read online, it appears that each story will have a back up story as well. Will the backup be solo adventures of our heroes or villains from the past or team adventures filling in some gaps from the TV show, and was their a Young Justice character, you wanted to include more of but just didn’t have the space to do so.

GW: There are always characters that we want to devote more screen or page time to. Always. As for the back-ups, the first one focuses on Red Arrow. As for the other five… wait and see! 

    Q7: I don’t see the point in putting a question when mine never get asked but whatever. In hopefully future seasons, will you be continuing to focus on the OG Team?

GW: If you don’t ask, you can’t get an answer! :wink: We’ll always pay attention to the so-called OGs. But each season is intentionally different from past seasons. But the best way to show growth in the characters is to have earlier seasons’ versions of those characters to compare them to. 

    Q8: My question is I’m curious to why Vandal Savage was chosen as the big bad or an important one at least and will his plan continues to grow in these comics?

GW: Vandal’s historic history, going back 50K years made the idea of putting him up against young heroes extremely appealing to Brandon Vietti and myself. But that doesn’t guarantee that he’s involved with EVERY story. So I’m not going to reveal whether he is or isn’t involved in Targets. No spoilers! 

    Q9: I’m a bit confused on the timeline, which might just be because I’m stupid, but is the child that Ursa is pregnant with in the season finale supposed to be, genetically at least, a version of Lor-Zod? Or did the present day Ursa already give birth to Lor?

GW: The former, if I’m reading your question correctly. 

    Q10: When will you two work on the next Gargoyles?

CJ: Look closely at the pages of the second issue of YJ Targets for the answer to your question…

GW: There’s an Easter egg there just waiting to hatch… 

    Q11: Hi Greg and Chris!! I absolutely loved the finale of S4 and all the episodes and how we got to see the original team again. Will the YJ Targets series introduce any new characters that we have not seen before and will some team members have new outfits and or designs?

CJ: It’s been only a short time since the conclusion of Young Justice Season 4, so the designs and outfits are pretty much unchanged since Phantoms, but you ABSOLUTELY WILL be seeing some new characters in upcoming issues.

    Q12: what made you decide to give Conner only some of his power from the comic in this series.

GW: We wanted to go with 1938 Superman powers. Powers that were simply an extension and expansion of what a human could do. So Infrared vision, as opposed to heat vision. Super-leaping instead of flying, etc.

    Q13: What was it like voicing Lucas Carr and being the one marrying Miss M and SB? After all this time, did you feel something special when you finished recording the dialogue that closed up what was opened back in pretty much episode 2?

GW: It felt like the culmination of a decade’s worth of work, honestly. You can hear Lucas choke up, and truthfully, I choke up every time I watch that wedding, especially the vows. (And, yeah, I know that sounds immodest, since I wrote them, but all credit to Danica and Nolan for voicing them with so much sincere feeling!)

    Q14: I know you said numerous times there will never be a definitive ending to Young Justice, that you only do open-ended closure.
    But i have to know do you have a ending for the Darkseid Saga planned? Because i feel like it’s leading up to be essentially your Infinity Saga.

GW: We have plans for where we’re going for most of our storylines. But Darseid Is… 

    Q15: I absolutely loved the season 4 finale. I have a nitpick-y question regarding the wedding scene. Conner mentioned that everyone there was “in the know,” so I’m curious about how Wendy Harris and Harper &amp; Cullen Row found out (as in, who told them and when)? Thank you so much for your time and another wonderful season! Can’t wait to read Targets!

GW: Harper and Cullen were filled in when they moved in with foster parents Lucas and Bethany. Wendy figured it out. I’m not going to go into any more detail than that, because we might want to SHOW those scenes some day.

    Q16: How does it feel to see some of the characters you designed for the comic tie-in (Sha’lain’a, King Sha’ark, Wyynde, etc.) make the jump to the series in seasons 3 and 4?

CJ: It was amazing getting to see characters we introduced (the YJ versions at least) in the comic make their way into the TV show. With the characters from the Atlantis arc especially, those characters had to be aged up in adapting them for the TV show, and I got to help update the design for Ronal specifically! I’d love to see more “cross-pollination” between the TV show and comic if they both continue!

    Q17: With such a talented voice cast with the likes of Jessie McCartney, Troy Baker, Tara Strong, and more on the show, have you guys ever considered doing a musical episode for YJ, and do you think it is still in the cards for the future?

GW: We always include at least one song per season. And Chris and Kristopher Carter and I produced a YJ RadioPlay at CONvergence convention one year that was a full-on musical. ([You can find it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ9Q4LJ3Lbk)) As for doing an actual musical episode of the show, I’d be game, but Brandon Vietti and I would have to find a valid reason - beyond just “Hey, wouldn’t this be fun (though a pain) to produce!” to make it actually fit into our fairly realistic Earth-16. 

    Q18: How much of the original 5-season plan is still intact?

GW: All of it, really. Keep in mind that plan was broad strokes. It wasn’t about little details. So we didn’t tweak anything on that broad strokes level based on the long hiatus.

    Q19: Will you guys be appearing in Comic Conventions in the East Coast this year?
    
    …and if you were given green light to do as you please within DC comics, how many more comics would you two put out right after Targets? How many more story arcs you already have in mind with these amazing characters in this amazing Earth 16?

GW: Personally, I haven’t been invited to any upcoming conventions anywhere, so… nope, I won’t be appearing. And I’d be willing to do as many comics as DC’ll let us do. REALLY, TRULY not worried about running out of stories.

CJ: I’m hoping to get to New York Comic Con this year. Between the pandemic and my schedule since moving to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers Animation I haven’t been able to get to a convention in a couple of years and I really miss getting to see fans!

And I’d always be down for more Young Justice comics if I could fit them into my schedule. I love these characters and never tire of helping tell their stories.

    Q20: Why did you make Hal suddenly look solder than his peers in YJ? He is actually younger than Bruce or Clark in comics.

GW: On Earth-16, Hal is actually a tad older than Clark and Bruce. But, really, the decision to have him be a bit gray at the temples was the choice of our original lead character designer and 3rd Season Art Director, Phil Bourassa. He suggested it, and Brandon Vietti and I said, sure.

    Q21: How long do you intend to keep teasing the return of Jason Todd?

GW: Who says he’s returning? :wink:

    Q22: Will we get to see more of wonder girl as she the leader of the outsiders ?!

GW: Yes. In Young Justice: Targets! Keep reading!

    Q23: Greg Weisman, will there be a sequel to Catwoman: Hunted?

GW: I have no idea, but I hope so. It was designed to be the first story in a trilogy of tales. We’ll just have to wait and see…

    Q24: Also, just wanna thank you for the representation of people with autism. I have it myself and I appreciate the whole arc about Rocket coming to understand her son through seeing Orion and how you acknowledge both the experiences of the autistic person himself and those of loved ones like parents. Man, I could go on and on and on about it lmao. Also just love all the representation in general. :00_dc_pride: :00_dc_pride_ps: :heart:

GW: Thanks. We’re always trying to increase the show’s representation on multiple fronts. We know how important it is to our fans. It’s important to us, as well.

    Q25: How is the process different when writing/drawing for the comics versus working on the show?

CJ: There’s a lot of overlap - it’s still drawing superheroes and visual storytelling. But instead of planning for movement in a static frame, you’re creating sequential art and having to figure out how to fit everything onto a page and allow room for dialog and make sure that the composition leads the eye across all the elements of the page in the correct order…there are a lot of differences!

GW: It’s not really all that different for me. It’s just about striving to tell stories in shorter chunks. A standard-length comic book issue is about the equivalent of 1/3 of an animated episode. And each page of a comic book needs to tell a mini-story of it’s own. Beyond that, I also need to keep in mind that I won’t have my voice cast to fall back upon, etc. And no ACTUAL movement, just the implication of movement. So I just have to remind myself to cover my bases differently.

    Q26: any new characters from this season going to be regulars in the next season? i liked megans family. they were fun to watch. hopefully more martians in season 5.

GW: No spoilers. (Assuming we get a next season.)

    Q27: will we see redhood in the series as we knew he died around season 2 it would be nice to see him.

GW: Who says you haven’t seen him? :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

CJ: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for supporting the show and the comic. We’d very much love to do more if there’s enough support for it!

GW: Out of time. But thanks for asking your questions. Hope you enjoyed the answers. Meanwhile, #KeepBingingYJ and READ #YoungJusticeTargets to help us #SaveEarth16!",DCcomics

I’ve just finished the book (DC Essential Edition, if you’re curious) and I’m just very confused as to why it’s called a Crisis. Nothing Universal in scale was ultimately altered unless you count the death of Batman. I won’t lie the last Issue especially felt very all over the place and I was pretty much confused the entire way through it but I enjoyed all other six at least. 

To me it felt inconsequential by the end, Superman had wished for the universe to be put together and aside from Batman being “killed” everything seems like it was put back to normal by the end maybe I’m missing something? 

COIE ended with all universes bar one being destroyed 

Zero Hour ended with Parallax essentially winning and displacing time

Infinite Crisis ended with the Multiverse coming back 

And Final Crisis…..what exactly?

From what I read, I get why he would want to become a vigilante, he seems to want to make up for the mistakes of his past, and has an issue with the wealth gap. Sure, that I get. But why be batman, though? He has the training, yes, but so far as I can tell, he is batman, because he randomly found one of his suits. Really, even in that issue, his friend called him out on his bullshit. No one thought batman was really dead, it was just a weak excuse, which I have no clue why he would need or want. And, OK, say he just took the costume and went for it, because he wanted to be heroic and protect his identity for the moment. Why not modify the costume afterwards, and call himself something else? Like, in universe, what is his reason of being batman. For a book called I am Batman, I still don't know his reason for being said character.

1655169909,TheBatmanWhoChuckles,My thoughts on what a shared DC Movie Universe could look like,"While I’ve enjoyed more of DC’s recent movie offerings, as a huge fan of DC, I still wish they could’ve built a more cohesive movie universe similar to the MCU. I just wanted to share my thoughts on how a film universe could’ve been done and wanted to see people’s thoughts on it.

 I’m just going to make a basic outline on a three phase approach, similar to the MCU’s Infinity Saga. Each phase would build to a Justice League movie that closes the phase out and the Justice League would be based off the classic team of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.

 
Phase 1:

This would obviously be the origin stories phase and each JL member would get their own solo movie. Now granted Superman and Batman could possibly be done without a straight-up origin story with as many solo movies as they’ve had and maybe just have quick flashbacks or references to their origins.

My only stipulation for each solo film for Phase 1 is that the heroes do not fight or come in contact with their arch enemies, which would come into play in the next phase. And possibly a couple of heroes could fight villains connected to Apokolips to have the presence of Darkseid ever looming in Phase 1. So maybe Superman could mainly be dealing with Intergang who have connections with Desaad and Kalibak or Wonder Woman could fight with Big Barda and the female furies (which could be a way to lead Big Barda down the superhero path).

The JL movie could be where the JL face off against Darkseid and while not full on defeating him, are at least able to stop him for this movie. I know a lot of people imagined Darkseid as a villain that caps off several phases similar to Thanos. I honestly feel he is a decent starting villain to bring the JL together that can always be brought back later as more powerful, plus the other JL villains I have in mind I feel can make the stakes much more personal as the movies progress.

 
Phase 2:

This is the phase where each hero would begin to be really challenged and face off against their arch enemies. So for instance Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex, Wonder Woman and Cheetah, Flash and Captain Cold, Green Lantern and Sinestro, Aquaman and Black Manta, and Martian Manhunter and Ma’alefa’ak.

Superman’s second movie with Lex could be the start to Phase 2. After Superman stops Lex in his own movie, Lex can come to the realization that stopping these heroes may require his own team. So he pops up at the end of each of the other movies recruiting the arch villains for each JL member.

This could also be a phase where other heroes are introduced to the world via each of the JL member’s solo movies or maybe having one or two new solo superhero movies, similar to Guardians and Ant-Man for the MCU’s phase 2, that way the world continues to expand and add new heroes. Maybe even in the Green Lantern movie you get an introduction to a new human, such as John Stewart, that will eventually become a Green Lantern.

Phase 2 would be capped off with a JL movie where, as already indicated, the JL fights against the Injustice League/Legion of Doom comprised of Lex, Joker, Cheetah, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Ma’alefa’ak. The story would be loosely based off Tower of Babel where the Injustice League learn of Batman’s secret plans he has created to take down each member of the JL in an emergency and they get a hold of them to take out each JL member. Maybe somewhere along the way Coast City gets destroyed which plays a part into Hal Jordan’s journey for phase 3. After the Injustice League is eventually defeated, the movie ends with the team feeling betrayed by Batman and removing him from the team due to his secret plans to take them out.

 
Phase 3:

This phase would focus on a theme of reflections where each JL member fights a villain that is essentially an evil reflection of them. The remaining JL members begin to see Batman’s point of view on plans that can be used to take them out if they went rogue, but at the same time Batman realizes in his own movie how he may have gone too far with his actions in secretly creating his plans.

For the movies, you could have Superman face off against Zod, Wonder Woman against Grail (which would also be a nice way to reference Darkseid again after three phases), Flash against Reverse Flash, Aquaman against Ocean Master, Green Lantern against Parallax, Batman against Prometheus, and Martian Manhunter against White Martian (not sure on this one completely).

In Flash’s movie, this could introduce the multiverse which will come into play in the third and fourth JL movies.

In the Green Lantern movie, Hal’s grief over Coast City’s destruction could lead to him being corrupted by Parallax, which is where John Stewart could step in as a new Green Lantern to help stop the threat and John Stewart gets inducted into the JL at the end after Hal takes a leave of absence once he is free from Parallax (or Hal possibly dies too in order to really raise the stakes in this universe by showing an actual league member dying).

In Batman’s movie, as he fights against Prometheus, he can see a corrupted version of himself in Prometheus and realize his mistakes with being so secretive about his plans. This Batman movie could also be the last one before the JL movie and Superman could possibly come in to help Batman, where they both make amends, and allows for at least one World’s Finest team up movie.

Again there may be other movies where new heroes are introduced in Phase 3 to continue to expand the universe.

Finally to close out Phase 3, there would be a two part JL movie which would focus on Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate. I imagine in the third movie, the JL members are approached by a good version of Lex from Earth 3 who asks for their help in overthrowing the Crime Syndicate. So the 6 JL members (with John Stewart being the new GL) take the fight to Earth 3. The JL would not win the first fight against the Crime Syndicate and the Crime Syndicate takes advantage of the knowledge of the existence of the JL’s Earth and go to conquer it. Of note, Batman may be mostly absent in this third JL movie to really get the feeling of at least one movie where Batman is off the team.

Then finally in the fourth JL movie, Batman finally makes amends with the remaining JL members after they have experienced what corrupted versions of themselves are like with the villains they faced in Phase 3 and after having just fought and lost to the Crime Syndicate. But Batman also admits his mistakes to the team too, possibly having also come across Owlman on his own in this movie too and learn even more what a corrupted version of him is like. The movie could end in an Endgame level fight of the JL vs Crime Syndicate on the JL’s Earth, along with the Crime Syndicate having brought over some evil versions of other heroes introduced in Phase 2 and 3 that could also all be involved in the fight.

This movie could end the three phase saga with the Justice League having finally expanded their membership and possibly a tease of a greater Crisis coming now that the multiverse has been introduced.",DCcomics

1655160501,Blue-Ape-13,The DCEU is confusing af,"Can someone explain if it's still happening or what? I know Reeves and Pattinson's Batman is in a different continuity. 

As far as I understand it, Black Adam, Shazam 2, Aquaman 2, Batgirl, The Flash, and Blue Beetle all are taking place in the DCEU? 

Apparently Michael Keaton is going to be Batman in Batgirl. But I thought Affleck was the Batman of the DCEU. Affleck is also supposed to be in The Flash, as well as Keaton, so now I'm very confused. It feels like this universe should just reset, with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman from 2017 being the only thing canon.
