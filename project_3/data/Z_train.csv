create a custom batman villain what quality doe he she have to challenge batman rule must have an appropriate name to their quality briefly explain their background in gotham give reason a to how they re adequate to challenge batman example the thwarter year old ex detective and another vigilante wa fired from the gotham city police department for accidentally shooting a suspect and is now dedicated to surpassing batman proving his identity a bruce wayne and defeating all gotham criminal i e joker harley quinn two face the riddler he ha incredible detective skill and ha amassed enough evidence that batman is bruce wayne batman must stop him
multiverse of madness mention of event in no way home did anyone catch the line where our dr strange mention an incident with spider man in ny which hinted at the event in no way home i thought that it wa supposed to be erased from everyone s memory including dr strange what do you all think
is madame web an all female spider verse movie i have a feeling it might be you have dakota johnson playing the titular character madame web i remember in the animated show s she put together a team of spider hero to save the multiverse sydney sweeney could be ghost spider spider gwen or she could be black cat and the silver and black movie ha been absorbed into this isabela merced must be anya corazon the monochromatic spider hero emma robert could be spider woman jessica drew or gwen stacy i saw some fan art and saw that she s pretty much a dead ringer for gwen or silver sable celeste o connor s could be either valerie the librarian a gender swapped mile morale a gender swapped and race bent peter parker peta petra or a race swapped julia carpenter or mayday parker honestly she could be anyone if they announce an asian actor that must be silk and possibly confirmation of the kind of movie they might be doing if it is an all female spider verse i just hope it s good they need to focus on telling a great and compelling story it ha the potential to be even more of a multiverse of madness than multiverse of madness i hope it doesn t turn out like ghostbusters or ocean the mcu ha made every single one of their hero a household name by making them great recognisable individual and compelling character i feel like madame web if done right can do the same
how will they kill off t challa in bp how do you think marvel will kill off t challa in black panther they ve already said and a half year ago that they won t recast nor use cgi so how do you think they ll deal with it i think they d maybe just have a clip of him sacrificing himself or something
how is dc so underrepresented in germany i wanted to get into comic a for while and a few week ago i started with marvel using marvel unlimited now my marvel knowledge is already big enough so i wanted to get a good look at dc but there is no way of properly consuming well anything here in germany we don t have hbo max or dc universe so we are limited to the right that amazon prime and netflix purchaed which only include the arrowverse s series a well a some other like titan or gotham the only animated medium is teen titan go i think so if i can t get the film or series i wanted to read the comic but a it turn out there is no way of reading the comic legally at least in my country so i don t even get the chance to legally like or know dc s work without having to spend a bunch of space and money for comic i am wondering how i can read the comic then and why warner bros seems to have no interest of offering a service to read the comic online a far a my research could tell me
i don t read dc comic ask my anything and i ll pretend that i know text

for my fellow dc fan what made you fall in love with dc comic because i wanna know your answer im keeping mine kinda short i fell in love with dc because of how they have legacy character that we can see our self in and because they seem to progress more than other comic character the ideal and human focus of god being humanized are what also pull me closer to them

day of future past v age of apocalypse wa it ever assumed that bishop and cable were probably preventing one future only to cause the others
ya know it rather frustrating how mcu synergy ha rendered the avenger and guardian line ups unchanging especially in adaptation like it a noticeable thing the avenger and guardian line ups in the show and game are always the movie group these are group with a fairly diverse array of character which a main appeal that the line up shift overtime with changing and member but when you look at avenger assemble the guardian cartoon and their square enix game it always the same exact character every time aside from only new guy falcon in assemble and kamala in the avenger game it extremally rigid especially when you notice how black widow and gamora are the only female member usually no scarlet witch no wasp no moondragon or phylum vell it always just those and of course this extends to the comic the guardian line up for most of the s until the cates run wa incredibly stale with the bendis and duggan run allowing just the movie a the only cosmic character the only new member wa during bendis run and it wa strictly earth character like iron man captain marvel agent venom kitty pryde and thing it like they were completely adverse to having a cosmic character that wasn t in the movie it bafflingly uncreative how restrictive they are with the line ups

all comic are political i find that sentiment all comic are political a lil odd if you don t mind me giving my personal opinion whenever i read comic like the injustice series a one example i never really thought there wa any politics in it in fact i detected more philosophical theme than anything political particularly on the moral philosophy of batman s deontological ethic and superman s unfortunate utilitarianism the interesting part of course is that these philosophical theme didn t try to present themselves a the main point either because the comic managed to include relatable real life like drama of what and how it would seem to be a superhero with those stake on the line either it s mainly an american thing where you guy consider politics to be somewhat similar to philosophy or any general aphorism in life or there isn t actually politics in the comic i read

marvel desperately need more game and better cartoon with how violently the mcu catapulted marvel into mainstream mainstream even during the early s there s not enough focus on other medium marvel disney ha a great opportunity to let other studio create i remember watching stuff like earth s mightiest hero when i wa younger i barely remember it now but it s how i wa introduced to marvel beyond spider man i heard recently it would ve had a third season that would ve been a big a some of the dc cartoon back in s but every bit of the cartoon and gaming department wa gut by marvel to be mcu adjacent the only good thing i feel we got out of that wa ultimate spider man and even then plenty of issue i only really remember watching the later season and got pretty good vibe from what it wa trying to do despite the flaw which i didn t gaf about at the time i loved it recent cartoon are terrible and they just feel like they re made to advertise the mcu and have horribly animation like they expected none of the audience to care the only good thing we got in a while wa spider verse marvel used to have a bigger variety of these cartoon and other non mcu content that could stand on it own leg not to mention the total lack of x men and fantastic four stuff during the majority of last decade on top of everything being mcu ad dc these day like to make stand alone animated adaptation of comic book story spin offs that treat all it lore like mythology they ve dominated everything except live action movie instead they just feel like soulless ad with no level of creativity we had a deadpool cartoon coming up but it got axed bc disney didn t like it something called tigra and dazzler too i hear hit monkey got a cartoon but i haven t watched it yet imo it look closer to the kind of thing dc would do with their hero if anyone s seen it please tell me so or otherwise a for their game it feel like that all dried up a the mcu picked up steam spider man wa a great game but it wa a console exclusive and the only good marvel game that decade that wasn t delisted gotg wa also pretty nice but avenger fucked up the perception of it and they probably won t be able to spring off of that any further marvel infinite wa just a big mcu ad there s just such a terrible lack in variety in anything that isn t live action and anything that is live action need to be mcu adjacent i hope in the future cartoon improve and we get a bigger variety of game which may happen that aren t mcu advertisement it s not too late either in fact now is probably the best time for them to start doing it since the movie aren t on the forefront of everyone s mind

theory glacatus is a baby eternity a far stretching a it is and i know there isn t so much a a nod to this idea but this theory or more so blind speculation had hit me what if galactus is just a baby eternity being the next universe since both entity seem to wear helmet that seem similar to one another how apparently galan before galactus became galactus wa one of the last remaining humanoid specie in the universe in my opinion i find it interesting to believe that galan wa purposely put in that position to become one with that dying universe becoming galactus and then becoming the next one over i know this is completely crack pot considering that eternity exists and other eternity do with no reference to galatus or them being galatus like being but i think it nifty considering that at the end of the known marvel universe that s official so that even concretely ha took place on the marvel timeline that franklin will merge with galatus and so would the iteration of the universe
thor love and thunder jump scare i m not a big marvel person but i m being taken to see thor love and thunder tomorrow afternoon i hate jump scare to the point that i get severe anxiety leading up to them and i ll often try to leave the theater before it happens i read on the imdb parent guide that there is an unexpected jump scare around the end of the movie having to do with gorr the god butcher and i am freaking out if you have seen the movie please spoil this for me i do not care if anything get spoiled please tell me what happens so i know what to look out for i beg

thor love and thunder thought just got out of thor i really enjoyed it not quite to the level of ragnarok but close i loved how thor went on with zeus and the thor jane moment were awesome i had no idea about india rose hemsworth s cameo but that wa also incredibly cool and sweet i did however feel the movie wa maybe a bit short like maybe another minute of scene with a bit more character development could have taken to another level the movie wa laugh out loud funny at time the theater i wa in cracked up multiple time but it felt like every other second there wa a joke especially in the first half of the movie i wouldn t want to see the joke cut or anything but minute total of spacing in the movie could have let the joke breath a bit better while helping emotionally develop thor jane and valkyrie no real big complaint otherwise bale wa awesome a gorr i know he wasn t a terrifying and evil a comic gorr but i think it wa a great portrayal feel free to comment and discus on the post i don t have anyone to nerd out about the movie right now

discussion so about injustice year zero we see that harley ha a daughter around year old but wasn t harley pregnant of her in the other comic before the prequel i m really confused with that
quick thought on m marvel finale alright now for the season finale of m marvel and it s not great now on paper the idea of kamala going out of her way to save a colored powered individual from a corrupt system of authority is a great one and at time it kind of work that is it work when it s kamala and kamran with kamala doing her own damage control ha against kamran s attempt to really hurt people that result in some fun and tense action when it come to kamala s friend trying to mess with damage control like they re meddling kid in an episode of scooby doo it s a little too silly like nothing that they ve done should have worked but the main issue that no normal ha isn t anything that happens in this episode it s everything that happened in the series that build up to it kamran having power isn t really a bad idea but how he got them involved this long and convoluted process that when you sit down and think about it doesn t make much sense it s almost a if it would have been better if he had power to begin with maybe through something like i don t know through a terrigen gas bomb that gave random people in the city superpower and forcing kamala to deal with them something that happened in the comic and that you could use future series movie to explain why such an event happened in the first place just a thought and hey if they did go the terrigen gas route it would also do a great job in building up damage control a the final threat they barely got any focus in this series all because all the attention went to the schmuck who died in the previous episode if we spent time with sargent what s her face dealing with other powered individual and being hostile to the one that are coincidentally people of color then we d have a decent villain that make for the perfect antagonist for kamala given both character background but no we needed to have this completely unnecessary story line smooshed into the series just so we can establish why m marvel is powerful enough to be an avenger by the way can we please stop this idea that a hero need to save the world to establish why they should be an avenger it hurt shang chi and the legend of the ten ring it hurt moon knight and it destroyed m marvel a hero doesn t need to save the world to prove that they re worth being one of earth s mightiest hero ant man spider man and black panther s solo movie were about them fighting villain who s motivation were to give dangerous weapon to others it s not world ending but it could still do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent people and that s fine kamala didn t need to fight these inter dimensional being who could potentially destroy everything in getting back home not when fighting damage control could be just a important and lead to an incredible message about a corrupt system in law enforcement the world doesn t need to be saved when helping a small number of people could do just a much good after all whoever save one person it is a if he ha saved all of mankind yusuf khan from the comic which do in fact matter a a whole the finale s a mess which make sense because the whole series is a mess too a far a i can tell m marvel nail the spirit of the character but it failed the most important aspect of her http www tumblr com blog view ordinaryschmuck source share and i do love the character expect for the boring and forgettable villain hell i ve kept saying that the best part of m marvel are the moment that make these character feel human especially the moment involving kamala s friend and family and the muslim arabic heritage if this wa just a series about an over imaginative girl who learned to appreciate her heritage and the people around her it d get an easy a for effort but it isn t it s a superhero series that try way too hard to be grand and epic when something small and personal would have fit much better so a is i d say m marvel s a maybe a if i wanted to be nice i don t know phase four of the mcu really is a mess and it s evident that marvel studio are focusing more on quantity than quality nothing they ve made is really that bad but they definitely need to take a break take a breath and reconsider what fan want from this franchise

lately the black cat ha became the best written character within marvel comic i m a long time spider man fan and felt really sad when they made felicia the new kingpin queenpin because it wa horrible writing all over the place after superior spider man she wa always a thief and an anti hero and one of peter parker s closest friend making her act the way she did during that time period wa really inconsistent to her core personality and standard she set for herself that is why it wa so heartwarming to see how the asm vol asm reestabilished her position within the universe processing img ij n b from this moment felicia played crucial part again in every major spidey event during the run of the series in one way or another important to mention here that during hunted event we get to see how she processing the fact that she can remember that peter parker is spider man and everything that come with it it wa unusual read because i rarely seen the character going so deep with her own emotion or just overall in marvel comic it s not usual for side character but i m glad it happened and we get to see what is happening to her during this time processing img gk k b the issue wa really good to read to see what is happening and how she try to get over it it must be difficult to realise that you wa in a relationship with a guy year ago then it keep happening all over again and it s all like yesterday a i said writer did an amazing job to reestabilish her and pete s frienldy relationship and they did an amazing job doing so meanwhile laying the foundation to her ongoing series issue in and a relaunch in if you did not read it i sincerely advise to do so because it s really fun and engaging series art style is so much better during relaunch but the first series also had a charm dr

other word that are barely enough to describe how black cat wa reestabilished in the past year a one of the best written character in the market you could find while making felicia hardy the most fleshed out hero lately felicia hardy is a much more fleshed out character right now than ever before and easily outshines many mainstream character that ha way bigger fanbase and story to work with her book are usually those gem reader like me are looking for during her run in we can see her hanging out occasionally with her mother and seeing her face with odessa a former love interest it help u

at all while she will have to deal with both fury and nighthawk batman she manages to win at the end obviously and reaching her goal with those people while getting out alive from the action after the series ended villa join mackay on art continuing their crushingly good black cat storytelling for a one shot mary jane amp black cat issue tying into the last arc of the previously mentioned spider man arc beyond what unfolds in this issue is a fun team up between mary jane and black cat the utter joy of this issue lie in the fact that these two aren t jealous of one another or played against each other instead they are working together to ensure peter doesn t get hurt while also bonding along the way in fact there s a rather touching final scene between the two that establishes their mutual respect how mary jane ha dealt with competing with other girl and a strong sense of understanding of each character processing img aly j pa b mackay writes both character in a natural and realistic way he also never put mary jane in a position that s too outlandish for someone who isn t a superhero the plot move along quickly with lot of surprise nod to spidey villain and more it s packed with content asm written also by jed mackay put heavy focus on the rehabilitation of peter by his friend steve rogers and felicia hardy mackay ha a firm grasp on peter s dynamic with both felicia and cap the former care for him enough to know that he can t suit up a spidey again without relearning his web slinging way while the latter s worked side by side with him a an avenger and know how to push him when needed both peter and felicia have been able to move more into being great friend that each can turn to since they know both their superhero and personal identity on a different level than others in their respective life understanding both side of peter felicia showed she understood that peter can t be his same reckless guy by just going back to being spider man like he would normally after recovering enough from such an injury i honestly have high hope that she will be important character of the spider man series a well having a blast already with her new ongoing series the iron cat where she team up with tony stark against a returning individual fromfelicia s past jed mackay ha revitalized the black cat character and elevated her to new height with iron cat we will see her shine once again and i do hope that new spider man run will be able to use her newfound direction and popularity who know what the future brings to her she can show up in the next spider man game too and fan pretty much want s to see her in the next spider man movie

so it turn out that a lot of thor love and thunder wa cut i wonder if taika waititi made a movie that wa way too taika and not enough marvel title but both christian bale and natalie portman have said in separate interview that heap of the movie wa cut sometimes it wa because thing were too scary understandable but others were thing like emotional scene with thor and jane even between jane and valkyrie do you guy think that marvel really weren t happy with what taika made and cut it up so it fit the brand better genuinely curious source http tenpiecesofeight com why wa so much of thor love and thunder cut http tenpiecesofeight com why wa so much of thor love and thunder cut
why doe the dceu have so much trouble lifting off whilst i understand that the dceu got it start much later than the mcu i cannot understand why it keep stumbling so badly like for example their inability to make sequel on time their inability to maintain the same cast their inability to decide on an overaching story and sticking to it an overall lack of direction the dceu ha more trailer than movie content we have a flash movie that we have been seeing trailer of for year now in fact i have seen so many flash trailer i m just not interested somehow they couldn t keep on henry cavill a superman nor ben affleck a batman why did they take so long to follow up with the justice league sequel some of these project have been so delayed that even if they were to make a sequel now the original cast have probably aged out the only thing they have got right are the standalone movie like joker and the batman but everytime they try to do an interconnected story it fall flat this isn t the dawn of the superhero movie superhero movie have been popular for at least year why can t they figure it out end of rant

question about red hood and black mask i m currently reading the rebirth run of rhato and both black mask and jason have yet to mention that red hood had pretty much declared war on black mask and even tried to kill him is there some reason for not mentioning this i didn t read the new run of this title since i heard it wa bad but wa this addressed there i haven t read a lot of the red hood stuff that is between under the red hood and the rebirth title in case it s mentioned somewhere during that period
i have an interesting theory about loki in the mcu and his series i noticed loki never used his actual power so my theory is that since the timeline during the mcu wa riddled with getting his butt kicked the reason why they might have picked that timeline to be sacred wa to thwart loki from his glorious purpose and never let him meet his full potential he never us his green spell magic he us to attack like in loki and if he can put a building back together before it fall on him crushing him and put it back standing up he could have taken the hulk with his mind so why didn t he and that would be a possibility in the multiversal roulette of choice that could have happened so why didn t they let him use that power on someone to quite literally move them without doing anything or even knowing he ha the ability learn to see memory and create an illusion with it i know that wa sylvie s power but if she can do it it s at least possible that they both can he just hasn t tried or why didn t he cause gap in attention you d think he d have been more sneaky than he wa in the mcu movie aside from that the loki he picked to suffer for so long before finding out there wa more he didn t even let him sit in while sylvie killed him instead he picked one where he got thrown into the tva and i think he wa lying about the amount of the timeline he d seen it seems only certain that since he only knew up to that point he knew he wa going to die because he hasn t seen passed it and you know he s not being straight up with them so he picked the variant of himself that thwarted his nemesis the most so he picked one that sylvie got mad at loki so he d have even le of a chance of being allowed by sylvie to bare witness further defeating him before he loosed the timeline letting out infinite amount of imprisoned variant of himself to start a war with the duo coming to the screen tho i think she d do well teaching him sneaky tactic she s got more stealth on him than a stealth bomber against a square metal wheel on a monster truck with enough power to burn out with it tho i will say that this is just where my mind go with this i don t actually know for sure it s just a theory i have that i hope happens i d love to see a dialog of the watcher happen after they show up monologuing it maybe even slipping in a fourth wall joke on the side would be awesome but still it d be really interesting to see if loki and sylvie turn out to be powerful all after this if she entere the mcu a a full time character and the whole mcu turn on it s head now that loki and sylvie are a formidable team and the only reason the watcher chose them a his protagonist is because they were the one always fighting him boom loki becomes the new main antagonist that shield is battling with all of his variant during a multiversal war loki v the avenger and the watcher variant army but the avenger won t actually know who they are fighting along side until it s too late

is there a lot of crossover in dc comic like there is in marvel sorry if this is a stupid question but i m new to comic i tried reading a bit of marvel via their marvel unlimited app i enjoyed them well enough but sometimes the amount of crossover between the series bugged me especially a a new reader for example i wa reading venom and to read the conclusion of a fight i had to jump to a certain issue of spiderman i think that happens to some extent in most of their series so i wa wondering if dc wa any different

my problem with the mcu s treatment of the multiverse my main problem is the blantant ignoring of earth a a designation for the mcu earth is and ha been the mainline comic universe for decade decade meaning there is and ha been one marvel multiverse for decade this is supported by spider verse and spider geddon which both feature cameo from cartoon and movie character with their own reality designation a iman vellani said if the mcu is earth then kamala is an inhuman and aside from the inhumans tv series and black bolt of earth if that really is the true designation seeing a apparently different universe call other universe different thing they don t exist in the mcu or at least the terrigen bomb which awakened her latent inhuman gene and power didn t this is unlike dc s multiverse which combine the main universe along with their previous incarnation and variation with the dark multiverse and other multiverses across all of their medium including the arrowverse dceu etc into their multi multiverse or omniverse the term omniverse is flawed because it comprises all version of reality real and imagined including ours which would include the entirety of the marvel multiverse however this can be easily explained away there are multiple crossover earth that are therefore part of both the dc and marvel multiverse meaning that it can be assumed that the rest of the other publisher s mulitverse exists but is understandably not able to be shown due to ownership and copyright so let s say marvel decides to make their multiverse like this ignoring year of history fine they still don t know the difference between alternate timeline possible future and alternate universe i am convinced that the writer don t actually read the comic and get most of their knowledge from the internet for example the timeline steve returned to in endgame should theoretically be an alternate timeline to the main or a every theory is calling it now but i refuse by the logic of loki this should be a different universe so how is steve able live to be old in the main timeline this should be a possible future and while possible future can be alternate universe time travel altering the timeline is not a reason for example earth the universe shared an identical history with earth the comic one but one event in it timeline caused a change that spiraled into the state it s in now also i ve heard people use america chavez never seeing a version of herself in another universe a evidence that it s a separate multiverse but by definition the multiverse is infinite she ha just yet to visit a universe where another version of herself exists i m also convinced marvel doesn t fully know it own universe in nwh we see villain from the mcguire and garfield film however their history is inconsistent with their counterpart from those film their transport to the mcu wa similar to in that though the universe ha a shared history that event in their timeline caused a new universe to splinter out without influence from another unlike loki would lead you to believe time is non linear so when this universe wa created at that point it had always existed separately and yet marvel treated this a the same universe alternate timeline similar universe but not the same this is unlike how tobey and andrew appeared in the movie they were pulled directly from their universe in present time not altering the history and therefore not creating an alternate timeline anyways thank you for indulging my rant

pricing on an old comic my father recently passed away and he left me an old comic book it s in a case to protect it it s silver surfer and signed by stan lee it s condition is graded by the cgc how much would this sell for if i decided to do so
how endgame will play out if the other half got dusted just a quick fyi that this is technically not my idea i just found it very interesting and am passing it on i saw this based on a video i also am going to try to keep this a close to the original event of endgame a possible so the first thing we need to know is who got dusted and in this scenario the following got dusted captain america thor black widow hulk rocket racoon war machine okoye iron man captain marvel hawkeye nebula and these are the following that survived black panther spiderman dr strange bucky barnes scarlet witch falcon wasp star lord drax mantis groot shuri ant man nick fury hank pym janet van dyne maria hill wong now there are two loophole to this the first is thanos who will be unsnapped in this scenario for reason and the second is ant man ant man wa originally snapped off in the video but in my version he stay before the time heist dr strange teleports the avenger on titan to the avenger compound and the one in wakanda will fly to the avenger base to get to thanos shuri will track the energy signature of the infinity stone to titan and to get there they can use the benetaur or black panther sponsor a wakandan ship to get there after they learn that thanos destroyed the stone scarlet witch will kill thanos or maybe they bring him back a prisoner after the year jump hank pym and janet van dyne bring back ant man who suggests time travel the avenger are on board the time heist begin of course with hank pym around they can easily make pym particle and scott lang suggests using he quantam realm with the combined effort of shuri hank and janet the time machine is born in this scenario the unsnapped avenger will go to the following place to gather the infinity stone morag knowhere vormir new york so let s start with morag in this scenario star lord and spiderman will go to morag to collect the power stone the two peter will bond by talking about movie or something of course during this time gamora is still alive and when star lord see her he will get all emotional and idiotic resulting in the thanos capturing him meanwhile spiderman make it back with the power stone now let s move on to new york in this scenario dr strange black panther ant man wasp and bucky will go after the time mind and space stone dr strange get the time stone from the ancient one no problem maybe the ancient one can give a few tip on executing the time heist better bucky will go after the mind stone and will fight the steve rogers black panther ant man and the wasp will go after the space stone but one thing happens after another and loki take the tesseract and dip because of the tesseract incident dr strange and black panther go to asgard to steal the space stone from odin s vault you know thor wa too drunk to point this out but the tesseract wa taken to asgard after the battle of ny using the benotaur or a wakandan ship shuri scarlet witch and falcon will go to knowhere to steal the reality stone from the collector shuri will get a ton of inspiration from the space journey finally we get to vormir in this scenario drax mantis and groot will go to get the soul stone of course on vormir one ha to sacrifice something they love to get the stone so drax will die a he never really did anything else before the time heist and he never had any motivation besides avenging his family the guardian of the galaxy are family and drax s death would motivate them to push their cause and also it would give drax an interesting point of view groot and mantis make it back now the thanos ha to make it back to the present thanos will learn about his future through star lord s point of view he then us star lord s pym particle to transport him his army and star lord to the present star lord will then convince gamora to switch side now it time for the snap itself shuri will make the infinity gauntlet out of vibranium now who will snap the gauntlet without thor captain marvel and hulk there really isn t that many people who can take the force of the infinity gauntlet dr strange is a good contender but i don t think he is durable enough to take the force rather i think scarlet witch will snap the gauntlet to bring everyone back wanda s power were enhanced by the mind stone so it make the most sense in my opinion wanda survives but is traumatized by the affect of the gauntlet thanos attack and the portal scene in endgame take place after this everything is the same a the original timeline let me know if you think the endgame will play out like this if the other half got snapped in the comment below

why do people think that m marvel accurately depicts muslim salam guy it s a genuine question have you just never seen a real muslim obviously we re not all perfect but a tv series about a girl who abandoned islam and take off her hijab for a boy is not at all conducive to the teaching of islam so then why do people think this represents muslim i promise you that most of the stuff in that series go against the teaching of islam so please keep in mind while watching the show that it s a horrible representation of what islam really is

i feel like the comic relief kinda killed thor no spoiler just want to say first that i liked the movie it wa fine but that s really it coming from thor ragnarok i expected a big comedic element but personally i would go a far a to say it wa incredibly overdone not to say it wasn t funny but i feel like it took a lot of the attention away from the dark tone the film could have had in simpler term i feel like they treated this movie more like a comedy than a hero action movie the point of comic relief is to act a a cushion for more serious section of a movie but there wasn t really much to take seriously what suck is that christian bale did a fantanstic job best villain we ve seen since thanos and it s a shame that all that momentum he built up wa kinda killed by certain weird joke about hammer i think if this film took on a little bit of a more serious tone it could ve been much better something along the line of how winter soldier felt there were some joke here and there but what drove the film wa the plot and the action sequence and i really feel thor lacked in this area again that s just my opinion feel free to share your opinion

who is wildstorm s poster hero which hero do you see a the spider man or batman superman of the wildstorm universe this could be the most popular hero or the hero that best represents the universe a a whole in my opinion the hero that come to mind are grifter midnighter apollo spartan or backlash if i had to choose i d say backlash most of the other hero have not had prominent solo story grifter is a decent choice but i don t think he ha the versatility potential of backlash however backlash hasn t been used by wildstorm much since their early day so that might prevent him from being wildstorm s poster hero

discussion so the tim drake special made tim look bad and did steph dirty my biggest issue with the tim drake pride special is how both tim and steph were written tim came across a massive jerk a he dumped steph without a reason and then ghosted her for month and quickly entered a new relationship from the get go and he wa actively avoiding her and it wa only by chance he came across her again he also had the nerve to ask steph if she wa mad at him not to mention during their talk he said she ha always been everything he ever wanted and more if that is the case then why dump and ghost her it make him look flaky and non commited to their relationship a while he did dump her before realizing he wa bi the story indicates that due to his questioning sexuality did he dump her which overlap with this there wa also the fact that introducing your partner who you had a very intense relationship with after dumping them for no reason ghosting them and reconnecting by accident to your new partner without telling them is a very inconsiderate and selfish thing to do he should have asked steph first if she wanted to meet him it s like he wa expecting them to be friend without even asking if that wa what steph wanted in the past tim wa hesitant to introduce steph to his new girlfriend a he knew it would be awkward and have some tension so this is ooc for him a well steph wa treated badly a well she instantly forgives tim and then upon meeting bernard fangirls over him and say it is the best day ever aside from the fact no one would act like that upon being treated like she wa it made her look like a prop just to shill bernard and reassure twitter tumblr that she isn t a threat to bernard she ha also never acted like this when meeting tim s other partner she acted polite awkward or showed jealously but subdued not allowing her to have complex feeling on the most important romantic relationship of her history life denies her agency and is a huge disservice to her

marvel magic related comic recommendation after coming away a bit underwhelmed by multiverse of madness there were part i loved but part that just didn t land or felt bloated cumbersome to me i ve wanted to dive back into the comic to get a fix of the mystical side of marvel again i m chiefly interested in character like dr strange the scarlet witch magik and nico minoru though i m open to looking at others a well i read a few story back in the day like the oath so i m preferably looking for something a bit more recent though i haven t read much of anything for at least a few year i think there have been a few mystically inclined team since then but i had a hard time tracking down name yesterday talking to the guy at my local comic shop any recommendation would be greatly appreciated

continuity and ego infinity stone theory half theory half headcanon on how these two extra infinity stone the continuity stone and the ego stone fit in the overall power distribution of the collective infinity stone continuity and ego stone http preview redd it kwwum w au png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s c c aaac ce ba c bc a the continuity stone one of the most common weakness of the infinity stone is that they only work within their native universe each universe of the multiverse is supposed to have their own infinity stone but taking one set of infinity stone outside it home universe leaf them empty of power in contrast deadpool s continuity stone is able to step outside of it own comic and into other continuity without losing power this stone could have the missing aspect of the infinity gauntlet that let it act on the multiversal axis just like the space and time stone let the infinity gauntlet act on the space and time axis each universe in the multiverse or each piece of medium would be it own continuity that this stone would let the other stone act across this could also be called narrative power or the power of fate the ego stone this one is more headcanon a the ego stone is more a vessel for nemesis but i am going to consider what power the ego stone would have on it own and what it could offer that is not covered by the rest of the infinity gauntlet assuming the ego stone ha a power like the other stone then perhaps it would be possible to use it a a vessel for one s own ego rather than just the ego of nemesis another common weakness of the infinity gauntlet is that not everyone is able to wield it power such a the stone in the mcu damaging both thanos and the guantlet after the snap using the ego stone could also it wielder to fuse their will with the infinity stone merging with them and even becoming a cosmic being like nemesis this could cover the weakness of wielding the power of the infinity stone and having a will capable of conceiving how to use their power it would also cover a third weakness of the infinity stone being able to be taken from you a they would be fused with your very being the other infinity stone cover infinite outward control but the ego stone could cover inward self control and will to control the overall power of the infinity gem other stone the ultimate universe is another instance of there naturally being eight infinity stone a far a i am aware they are never named or explained but i will still count that a a win for the continuity and ego stone being a natural part of the infinity stone collection the stone growing inside tony stark s head could even fit with being the ego stone without nemesis ego other infinity stone that i have seen do not a naturally meld with the original six infinity stone both the death and rhythm stone that i have seen are not natural infinity stone but fake created with the reality stone the lego build stone i have not seen much about but it seems to me like it would just be that universe s name for the reality stone then lastly the battlerealm stone the nightmare evolution genesis war chaos and death stone appear to be artificial infinity stone a well and though their power are not delved into much they seem to act like corrupted version of the regular infinity stone rather than being a true part of the set tldr the continuity stone cover the multidimensional weakness of the infinity gauntlet and the ego stone cover the ability to fully wield the power of the infinity gauntlet

discussion garfield logan the sensitive soul with a big heart gar logan hold a special place in my heart for many reason whether it s his enduring positivity in the face of grief and trauma childlike joy in using his animal power or remaining true to his offbeat self in spite of others telling him to get serious i ve always found the character a source of comfort recently i found one of the best profile i ve seen of gar http www cbr com teen titan beast boy gay that connects some of these dot making a case for his continued relevance and future potential putting aside the clickbaity title some thoughtful point are made and pattern emerge in how he relates to others the key premise is gt beast boy is an incredibly romantic person at heart someone who love to love and yearns to be loved he s a sensitive soul with love for everyone in his heart the author go a step further to describe gar a a queer coded character i think this is open to interpretation i happen to agree but at the very least these quality are rarely represented in male character in comic and to me they re quite welcome and important notably the author leaf sexual attraction out of the analysis completely focusing on the queer aspect of simply being outside the norm in how one approach romance platonic friendship or expression of love in general i think very few recognize this aspect of gar certainly not at dc a long a grim dark story sell his potential will continue to be overlooked but i think story with more heart indeed where being a cheerful goof is a super power would find an audience in these bleak disconnected time a a peculiar sort myself i always assumed my take on gar existed only in my own mind but perhaps others see it too anyone feel the same

i m not a fan of the revelation in curse of the man thing x men so i do like the backstory of ted making a deal with demon it help to further explain why man thing seems so connected to magic but i don t like the idea that he created the nexus of reality i much prefer the idea that the nexus just exists no real explanation the florida everglades just house a random portal to anywhere it make it seem much more mysterious and almost eldritch at time the nexus seemed to almost have a kind of it s own and a it macabre protector stand the shambling husk known a the man thing i realize man thing isn t a super important character but i personally thought the fact he mostly appears in cameo extremely randomly add to the appeal much like the nexus itself it made him more mysterious being some anomalous force even master magician like dr strange or super scientist like hank pym can t fully explain or understand

how did vulcan survived at the end of wok war of king so a little while ago i wa doing some rereading of some past x men story written in the s because i wa shocked to learn there wa actually a rd summer brother aka gabriel summer vulcan which suprised because he wa such an obscure character that i didn t knew existed so i decided to do some research and read story arc regarding this rd summer brother what i found interesting is that at the end war of king vulcan wa severly injured by black bolt to the point where what s left of him are bone and muscle yet somehow and also he lost his prosthetic eye which replaced the one he loses to gladiator but the next time we see him in the krakoa x men era he wa a good a new like there wa no damage done to him and according to his memory it doesn t seem like he wa severly injured during his time trapped in the vault while i don t know how is this possible there are some few gu a stated in his marvel database page while vulcan can manipulate energy to heal himself his power were not strong enough to the point where he can regenerate lost portion of his body such a losing his eye to gladiator so it could be possible that vulcan s healing power elevated to a regeneration level allowing him to regenerate his whole body but that seems le likely possible unless the writer decided to change that the second guess is that he somehow transformed himself into pure energy and merged with black bolt before being extracted by the eldritch being in the vault now this theory wa suggested about year ago by a comic book reader rereading some of hickman s run for the ff and spotted the drawing are exactly mirrored the one in x men and since how black bolt escaped the vault wa never explained to u we can guess something must have happened between the two the link for the theory http twitter com abyssalodin status s http twitter com abyssalodin status s the third guess is or what i believe is the most reasonable answer is that during the end of war of king vulcan and black bolt did indeed died in the end of king of war however at the end of their battle both fell into the vault and doing some research the some called vault vulcan wa trapped in wa actually the cancerverse if you don t know what the cancerverse is it s basically a reality in which death no longer exists thus nobody can die in that universe and it is being invaded by cthulu or eldritch being due to it unique property of lacking the concept of death even if you re from another reality once you die in this universe you will be completely healed and revived there this ha been proven in guardian of the galaxy vol http marvel fandom com wiki guardian of the galaxy vol when star lord use the cosmic cube successfully obliterating thanos to ash only for thanos to remerge second later and kill quill then not so far away from his place of death quill wa also completely revived and healed with no sign of injury therefore i believe that by the end of wok both actually died but due to them dying in a universe where death doesn t exist they both got instantly revived and healed of all previous permanent injury explaining why when we later saw vulcan reappeared in hickman s x men run there wa no sign of his scar or his prophetic eyeball amp x b amp x b vulcan being severely injured by black bolt http preview redd it v jt mmu png width amp format png amp auto webp amp s ea f e ac e f da a ced b

sony s sinister six franchise what ll it take to create the new anti hero avenger for gue able reason sony is trying to set up their sinister six a anti hero avenger while their first two member were ready a is kraven will reportedly be an animal lover now to fit a more heroic mold what other tweak do you think sony will make the roster will apparently be venom they leaned hard into the lethal protector thing in venom and made the symbiote super likeable done morbius in the comic morbius range from anti hero to hero already the film mismanaged this making him into more of a hypocrite and killer but they clearly thought they were creating an anti hero so he theoretically fit the role already but in practice will need a lot of fixing related tangent the film flopped hard and it star ha been accused of raping minor do you think sony will proceed a planned replace leto or quietly drop morbius from the line up vulture i m not sure how i got here ha to do with spider man i think i m still figuring this place out but i think a bunch of guy like u should team up could do some good intriguing but how will sony turn toomes into an anti hero he s only ever acted in his own self interest and to protect his family he kept peter s secret but it seemed to me that it wa because he owed him one for saving liz and himself wa the allure of morbius strong enough to morb right over vulture s selfishness kraven actor atj recently said that kraven will be more of an animal lover in this film which is surprising a kraven wa always the epitomy of the safari hunter slaughtering rare and endangered creature will this rebranding work at least kraven ha always had an ironclad code of honor so that help him seem quasi heroic i guess madame web we don t know much will dakota johnson play cassandra or julia will she be just a clairvoyant or explicitly connected to the web of life fitting her into an anti hero team will be easy the real challenge may be giving her an exciting film el muerto a super powered luchador played by rapper bad bunny i mean this is either gonna be hilariously enjoyable or absolute garbage right there s no in between past that i ve gotta be honest i know nothing about this character doe the anti hero thing fit so a far a we know that s the sinister six not exactly a classic line up but did sony pick the right character for their not the avenger super team franchise

lost print ad featuring the justice league hi all this is probably a shot in the dark but having seen so many video of lost medium being found i figured i d give this post a shot i didn t fit the criterion for the lost medium subreddit but i figure there may be a dc fan or two here that could help me out in the early s i remember having either a magazine or a comic book that had a very cool looking advertisement in it i think it wa either for a sport beverage or maybe even sneaker but it included d animated model of the justice league if my memory serf me correctly it wa the lineup of the animated series from the same time period superman batman wonder woman green lantern flash hawkgirl and martian manhunter while i m sure it look dated by today s standard i remember thinking how realistic they looked i lost the original in a flood about a decade ago and haven t been able to find it after countless internet search anyone else remember this or think they d be able point me in the right direction thanks for your time

original icon appreciation post so with all the milestone reboots that have been going around i decided to finally check out the original or rather start with the original icon and work on from there and after getting half way through i can safely say i m hooked yeah the artwork is quintessential dark age but i love how these character play off of each other and just how alive they feel don t get me wrong the character in the remake certainly exist and they deliver their talking point just fine but the original are just on a whole other level of organic fun i want to read the rest of the series just to see more banter between augustus and raquel or more scene with buck wild or even to see if they interact with more character in the main dcu like how rocket and superboy played off each other superboy learning what a belly button is will live in my memory forever short and sweet i see why this is a classic and i can t wait to work through the rest of the dakota chronicle

how did you start with marvel unlimited hello fellow marvel fan i started with marvel unlimited like one month ago and wa wondering how you read pick the story i am a completionist so i searched for a guide on cbookherald which start basically at avenger disassembled from that point roughly i want to work my way through the comic until i am up to date lastly i inserted the darg age just for fun and also i skip some issue from hero i dont have interest in how do you structure it without the guide i would have never get some tie in right and i find it rather overwhelming to just start somewhere also how did marvel set thing up are the first story outdated or are there retcons because of new story i dont quite get it

the issue warning long read so a lot of people have a lot of opinion on the mcu being earth some good some bad but i don t think people have touched on the big issue with the mcu being earth it s that the mcu is too different to be let me elaborate so earth is supposed to be the prime dimension for marvel all of the event happen in a very specific way and all of the character are very specific people i think that the mcu ha strayed too far away from the source material to be that particular universe some example of this would be the character to me the one that stand out the most is mj in earth she is a redhead caucasian girl and her name is mary jane watson in the mcu she is a lighskin black girl with the name michelle jones watson it would be one thing if they just changed what she looked like but they changed her whole name too if this were the prime universe for marvel then she would look exactly how he doe originally and she would have the same name it s not just her either taskmaster had the same problem in the comic his name wa tony master and he wa a mercenary in the film it wa dreykov s daughter with a name that kinda resembles the original name but not really it would make more sense if these character were from variant universe the major marvel event such a civil war are too different from how they originally happened a well i m not saying that they should do the exact same thing but just in movie form i m just saying that this is a film adaptation of these character and event so they should stay consistent with how these thing transpired and who the character are but at the same time adding their own spin on it to make it more interesting while not rewriting the whole story i honestly don t think that they should have made it earth they should have just tried to make it it s own universe plus how cool would it have been if the real wa out there and it s just like the comic universe or it is the comic universe that would have been so much cooler in my opinion

from the perspective of the continuity what s the point of age of apocalypse not a rhetorical question i genuinly sincerely would like this question to be answered to give some context can skip down to where it say skip if you don t care i am in the process of physically collecting all the most important and significant of the classic x men comic to fill out the important detail of their continuity and put it in chronological order and some of them are even more modern retellings of either already told or untold story in chronological order they are x men season one dark phoenix saga day of future past god love man kill mutant massacre and well the age of apocalypse omnibus most recently after saving up money for that monstrosity skip so either way i have already been skimming through the page of x men the age of apocalypse and read up the plot synopsis and stuff like that and i realize it s set in a twisted version of the world they knew earth and it s about bishop fixing the timeline to get back to earth again so it s like flashpoint of dc comic but instead of flash it s bishop in other word absolutely nothing happens in this comic that matter to continuity other than maybe the fact that bishop remembers it all the reason i am confused about this is because i ve been told countless of time that x men the age of apocalypse is the definitive apocalypse story to demonstrate what type of character he is what his background is and what his power are have i been decieved i would really really appreciate people s input on this it s bad enough that it s a ridiculously huge omnibus that feel daunting to get into and it s also bad enough that it s filled with bad s artwork but now i also hesitate to even read it because it doesn t seem like anything in it even matter and just a disclaimer lastly i m not saying the story is going to be bad i m sure it ll be great or not i really have no idea but i collect these comic because i care about the character and the world building for the continuity

marvel becoming kid oriented month ago i notice the sudden change marvel studio seemingly started to become more for kid and le for the older fan first with the appearance of m america in multiverse of madness followed by m marvel then now in thor for those who seen it marvel seems like it s slowly becoming more and more kid i understand alot of these character were already in comic but it feel like we re starting to get alot more kid superheroes and kid like content all at once
if thor drop his hammer in space can anyone pick it up there s no up or down in space and space make every object is weightless so if thor let go of his hammer in space iron man should be able to move it around or my thought for the opposite is that they can hold on to it but it doesn t move at all when they try to move it can just move along by itself carrying the person along with it
anyone else notice this in thor ragnarok i know love and thunder just came out but i wa rewatching ragnarok because i can it wa the scene where thor get the introduction to the grandmaster and in the background is the instrumental to pure imagination from willy wonka and the chocolate factory i thought that wa pretty cool and i never noticed it before

do you think dceased should be an animated movie series or an animated tv series with multiple season just a random thought that came to me view poll http www reddit com poll vdso
what number would you designate the mcu universe okay so a we know the mcu universe ha been designated a in mom and m marvel s own iman vellani ha said that it s actually or something like that of course feige stated that the mcu is it s own thing entirely and ha no multiversal connection to the comic which is dumb imo so with that being said what if it wa what if the mcu wa apart of the same overall multiverse that is connected to the comic what would the mcu universe be numbered i wa thinking maybe instead of a number it would be a name like infinite infinity lemniscate to kind of draw in the fact that there are an infinite amount of universe for those who only casually view the movie and don t read the comic let me know what y all think
what is jace fox motivation to be batman i think i have read all or almost all of jace fox batman content and for the life of me i could not tell you why jace decided to take the batman mantle from what i read i get why he would want to become a vigilante he seems to want to make up for the mistake of his past and ha an issue with the wealth gap sure that i get but why be batman though he ha the training yes but so far a i can tell he is batman because he randomly found one of his suit really even in that issue his friend called him out on his bullshit no one thought batman wa really dead it wa just a weak excuse which i have no clue why he would need or want and ok say he just took the costume and went for it because he wanted to be heroic and protect his identity for the moment why not modify the costume afterwards and call himself something else like in universe what is his reason of being batman for a book called i am batman i still don t know his reason for being said character what do you peep think wa there ever a reason given for why he continues to be batman and not say batwing

why is the dc multiverse so not connected what i mean is that in the marvel multiverse no one universe ha the same designation aside from mom calling the mcu earth because i m convinced the writer don t actually read comic so doe the actress for kamala khan look it up it s one whole multiverse with each timeline and adaptation being different universe and yes the multiverse ha been rewritten just like dc ha the crisis event but in dc you have multiple earth s etc and by my understanding the multiverse only ha universe but also doesn t it s considered that it s all one multiverse but not designated a such it s honestly just confusing and it s one of my barrier for entry into dc after being a marvel fan for almost my whole life

how doe the marvel fan feel about kevin feigi so a last week i posted a question to this sub about comic v mcu i wa surprised that there were some hate directed towards feigi i consider myself a marvel fan since i wa a kid and started collecting comic in the s and wa happy we got marvel film in s and later the cohesive mcu started in s so i can t for the life of me understand where the hate wa coming from all i see are disagreement with how certain character and story were written and the multiverse number so how doe the community in general feel about kevin feigi s mcu rollout and general direction
doe anyone else hate what the mcu have done to korg amp miek not sure if this is the right sub for this but doe anyone else hate how korg and miek have been portrayed in the thor movie in the original planet hulk world war hulk story that they appeared in they were both badass warrior albeit miek turned out to be a snake at the end whose only purpose wa to fight it s the reason that miek betrays hulk at the end to get him to continue fighting in the mcu they ve made these two character joke their only purpose in the film are for comic relief thought
m marvel show review spoiler so i just saw episode of m marvel and here are my thought it wa great even though there were some problem i thought this wa the best episode of the season why weren t any of the other episode a good a this one the action wa top notch with good cgi on m marvel s power and kamran s power kamran s power are soo beautiful and cool to look at they are blue and soo comic accurate he us his power almost like cosmic blast kamala khan s power are the same but in a different color she us them differently almost like forming construct like green lantern but not a complex the way she us them in the show is such a call back to her power in the comic she even say embiggen in this episode when she kick as using them to do awesome thing m marvel isn t comic accurate though i love all the pakistani heritage and representation she is a hero for that type of culture and it s great and comic accurate but in the show bruno who i love he s such a great character he say in the episode that kamala is a mutant and that her power are a mutation that doesn t make any sense at all because just last episode they were talking about her being a gin this whole season her heritage and power were explained to u a a gin kamala is a gin who get her power from the noor dimension but now in episode she s a mutant that mean this whole show ha just been a big waste of time marvel spent most of the time trying to fit m marvel into the cosmic world of the mcu saying that she s connected to captain marvel somehow in some way when she is not her power seem more magic in the show this adaptation hasn t been working out so they call her a mutant now it s so messed up and very confusing how is her power a mutation if she get it from the noor dimension she can t even use them without the bangle and since she s a mutant doe that mean her heritage is too like her great grandmother or kamran s mother is kamran a mutant too because that also doesn t make sense he ha the same power a kamala mutant are born with their power and they all have different ability not the same also mutant power aren t inherited either m marvel can also shape shift too which i think is also from the comic she shape shift into captain marvel in episode what s up with that this whole show overall ha just been a big convoluted mess episode were great episode were ok and episode were the best of the season but also just ruined kamala khan character i hope captain marvel can explain her a little better than this show did i also hope we get to see bruno again he s awesome also the red dagger character is good too i want to see him again her parent continue to be a great addition to her character i loved that her mother made her superhero suit she looked great her father also gave her her superhero name with that amazing speech that made my heart smile damage control wa soo bad i wa soo annoyed with them this whole season so far to me this is the fourth best marvel disneyplus show it wa good in some part but very confusing and not comic accurate which ha caused the story to suffer i usually don t care about marvel not being comic accurate but when the story start to suffer because of the change they made to a character that s when it s a big problem

the mcu ha changed forever since the release of disney so with disney becoming a streaming service the dynamic of the mcu ha forever changed disney is trying to compete with other streaming service like netflix and the only way to compete is to push out new content which lead to new subscriber the disney content is coming like tsunami a you are seeing with netflix after a certain point the content is just not a good because of dilution and for other reason a well with netflix there are so many show and movie but rare ozarks or stranger thing with the mcu disney is going to pump agatha and other show to keep the subscribe count up they certainly can afford to some show may hit or miss but they will exist whether you like it or not so picture netflix except all their netflix original show and movie are connected with some exception but i personally dont like to blend character from show to movie with the exception of cameo for example wandavision is connected to d mom m marvel is connected to the marvel the disney show are now a pipeline to the movie this lead to occasional form of dilution wa it really doctor strange s sequel similar to captain america except now incorporate disney content a well i personally think there should be boundary between disney and mcu movie only time will tell so yeah disney is a streaming service and cash rule everything around mcu
best dc comic for somebody not really into mainstream superheroes i m not totally against them in fact i love a lot of batman s stuff but i ve never been into all the really tropey good guy v bad guy super hero action it just isn t deep enough for me i love a well developed story and or world and a great character is a necessity i prefer somebody who isn t omnipotent or ha obvious plot armor somebody who struggle a we all do and i prefer the threat around them to be well developed a well i can get around the threat if the protagonist s are well developed but somebody who ha fallen into evil for a very relatable human desire i often find most compelling for example the reason i like batman a lot is everything around him is well developed we have the entirety of gotham city with all it nook and cranny full of malicious intent waiting to be uncovered many of the villain fell into their persona due to their own fall from grace mental illness or greed and batman himself is only a human with fancy gadget a well a a traumatized child and a victim to the worst kind of robbery life so for those of you who enjoy a well developed narrative similarly what have you enjoyed my mind is fresh within dc a well a comic in general so please nothing that requires too much if any background knowledge
is there anywhere left for the mcu to explore conceptually hey everyone it should go without saying that i love the mcu movie and i m not trying to critique i kind of have an existential concern for the franchise part of what made the mcu movie so appealing to non comic book fan audience besides just being great movie in general wa that the movie did a great job of adapting comic book style story telling into movie format foreshadowing cross over serialized story event etc this type of story telling wa immensly well received climaxing with endgame which i think is an appitome of the type of comic story telling they had been doing foreshadowing and building towards event movie you could say is something unique to this series and what ha kept movie fan invested for all those year during the infinity saga the problem is how many different type of event can you do without becoming redundant like if marvel decided to build towards another big baddie essentially an analog for thanos like god doom or maybe even kang i don t think people would care a much it would inevitably just be compared to infinity war and endgame i guess unless the stake of the story were pretty different i feel like the most comic story trope have been used already because there ha already been such a great variety of story already told in the mcu conceptually is there much else to explore with these comic style story i am kind of doubtful even with superhero comic we see the story usually follow certain trope and storyline the interesting one have variation but it is kind of similar nonetheless and the people that really enjoy these story become the comic book fan when this happens some may think it already ha with the movie the perception among movie fan probably will be that the next upcoming film is just another marvel movie instead of the next exciting blockbuster film what can they do about this not sure if they can recapture the magic of the infinity saga again but they can keep creating quality film maybe get experimental like how some comic are recent film have kind of been doing this doe that defeat the purpose of having an interconnected series kind of but the movie can t be propped up with that a the gimmick i hope they can continue their success in bringing crazy comic book concept and story to the big screen including some more awesome event movie i wa hoping for a house of m avenger movie a i thought that would be unique enough and elizabeth olsen is a great actress but i doubt we are getting that now because we kind of already did get it secret invasion could be really tense but there are some similarity to winter solder original sin could be a good way to do an event but keep it character centric god bless if you read through my rambly thought i got thinking about this because i am excited for the upcoming thor movie but have not been a interested in the disney stuff and some of the phase movie i m not expecting cinema history to be broken with thor but i like chris hemsworth s take and i am hoping to see more of the norse mythology stuff from the comic in it ultimately i think this will be the forseeable future of the mcu s appeal more individual character centric tldr i feel like adaptation of comic book story telling to film is what made the mcu uniquely appealing and got people excited to follow along a we hadn t seen that with film before but that can t be a selling point forever or else it becomes a gimmick which defeat some of the purpose of the mcu instead they should focus on just making good superhero movie superhero story have their trope and usually follow similar plot so unfortunately it might just be considered more of the same and just another marvel movie then superhero movie might become kind of niche again but i hope marvel can continue their success in making new movie with event or c d list character and make them unique and compelling enough to be popular

going to read all of supermanfrom the epic meltdown over gay city http www reddit com r dccomics comment vabspq im going to read all of supermanfrom the http www reddit com r dccomics comment vabspq im going to read all of supermanfrom the superman story the cover of this story ha man being shot while striking a ballerina like pose just thought i would put that out there apparently a gang called the black gang it s not what you think ha been terrorizing the city a reporter from a rival newspaper named peter peeker oh for the love of ha been getting the scoop on them naturally the editor of the daily planet say lois and clark need to get a scoop on them or they re fired like a good bos would do so lois and clark decide to go undercover a socialite to a local night club where the black gang strike lois dye her hair blonde and clark take off his glass although lois still doesn t recognize him a superman great reporter she is at the club lois make clark shell out money like it s going out of style to draw attention to themselves they attract the attention of peter peeker don t do it don t make the joke you re better than this believing him to be rich a woman spends time time with clark and eventually asks him to take her home on the way the car is ambushed by the black gang because of the black hood but clark flees and quickly change into superman peter peeker just gonna clench my teeth offer to drive lois to a better club but instead drive them to the black gang s hideout showing he wa working for them they find out who lois is attempt to kill her and superman bust in to stop them he then make them dance by throwing bullet at their foot like the great guy he is before tying them up and calling the police clark and lois then write up the story about the dirty reporter whew the name they pick for people i already had one meltdown over gay city hahahahahaha we don t need another one i m really beginning to wonder why clark ha such a thing for lois they go to the club because it wa her idea and then she make him hemorrhage money just to get attention he even gave out a bill which in today s money would be shut up don t question my math he s said numerous time that he like that lois sticking her nose into thing and getting into trouble but at the same time she s never nice to him because she think he s a weenie however he act like a weenie to keep her from thinking he s superman this brings up two possibility one he could not work for the daily planet so she would never think that or two he could just date her a superman then again logic wa never the strong suit for mr let s destroy a section of metropolis that s poor man action comic cover date november it s summer in metropolis but the city is covered by a blizzard clark go to interview the weatherman but he ha no explanation suddenly a woman over the radio say she ha information on why it s frozen over and will only tell it to superman clark is sent to the location with lois butting in and deciding to scoop the story a woman arrives along with a blonde companion at the metting site a car pull up full with uh let s say um le than flattering drawing of arabic people abruptly they fire a mechanism at her that launch a glowing ball of light when it hit her she disentigrates a policeman come running but they shoot and dissolve him too then lois arrives and finally superman swoop in and rescue her the let s say middle eastern men then grab the blonde woman that had come originally and threaten to kill her superman apparently forgetting he ha super speed grab lois and bound away we then briefly cut to to the sahara desert where a man named carlton vogel ha found the lost city of ulonda before he can celebrate men come by on horse firing those ball of light and disintegrating them the men who attack say their leader is zolar back in the present the middle eastern gentleman attempt to get the blonde woman into a rocket they fire that globe thing at superman but it only knock him unconscious so they take him too later he wake up to find he and the blonde woman are chained up it turn out she s laura vogel brother of the guy who found the city and they are looking for a guy named zolar apparently zolar ha great store of radium which apparently power his ray gun and weather controlling machine laura then give a bizarre reason for the snowfall in that zolar s people said she had until the first snowfall in metropolis to tell them where the lost city wa and then made it snow moving on zolar then appears in a screen with his giant face but despite the fact that he s a bald mad scientist he is not in fact lex luthor they then arrive at zolar s fortress where superman go crazy and start wrecking stuff to get him to stop zolar start dropping glowing orb on ulonda superman leap onto zolar s rocket and demand zolar order his ship to crash with the people on it zolar complies and all of his ship crash to the ground oh my freakin god it is then revealed that laura is in fact working for zolar and the first woman that had been vaporized wa originally luara she launch one of the orb at superman but again it only knock superman out it then bounce back and hit zolar and the woman vaporizing them both superman wake up and return to metrolopis where the weather ha returned to normal okay okay superman straight up killed people this isn t like oh a richochet bounced off and hit the bad guy no he ordered a guy to to crash his rocket full of people and then the evil genius just doe it what in the madness of corn cob is this did no one bring this up in the writing room i can t even add to the golden age kill count because there s no telling how many people superman killed that wa a monstrous thing to do and the fact that the bad guy wa just like okay like superman would just let him get away after that also logic didn t exactly prevail in this issue did it i get that the blonde woman wasn t really laura but the story about the first snowfall wa kinda dumb they didn t have to freeze metropolis they could have just put a gun to laura s head and make her talk there wa no reason to do winter in july just to draw attention to yourself also also and i don t want to harp on this point too much but the arabic people have like green skin for some reason like i can t tell if that s racist or like a color error this wa one bonkers violent nonsensical superman comic and i can t even comprehend how they thought it would work more of this please i need this inject it directly into my vein action comic cover date december clark and lois are on vacation together but apparently not a a couple i guess and they decide to go to the small town of brentville to relax when they get there however everyone in the twon is dead asleep and lois follows soon after clark go to a fire station where they apparently have gas mask and put them on himself and lois he then drive to the edge of town where the gas he never got confirmation it wa gas might be lighter he find a house and try to use the telephone of a professor the professor s assistant however attempt to hit clark over the head with a wrench which obviously doesn t work lois wake up but she and clark spot a car full of people in gas mask driving down the street they tail it to find they are breaking into a bank lois rush in but they take her mask off and she drop unconscious this allows clark to change into superman he beat them up and take off their mask dropping them like fly more people come to investigate the town but all keep falling asleep on the street the police arrive in gas mask and find lois and clark they accuse them of being a part of this but clark say he wa the one that phoned them and to go check with the professor only the assistant is there and he call clark a liar getting them both arrested and locked in a room clark knock out lois with a nerve pinch and turn into superman it turn out someone is filling the room with hydrocyanic acid he break out and carry lois away when superman return he discovers that the assistant ha been working with a foreign agent to get the sleeping gas for his country the gangster who were trying to rob the bank worked for the assistant and weren t part of the original plan superman decides to dig under the house and create a tunnel from the outside i mean okay and find the professor in the cellar superman escape with him but return to find that the foreign agent now named munsdorf and the assistant have come to the cellar seeing that the professor ha escaped the agent shoot the assistant munsdorf whip out a ultra modern atomic gun and shoot him it doesn t affect superman so munsdorf then fire it at a nearby house where lois just so happens to be superman rush to save her but when he return munsdorf is attacking the professor superman block the ray and in a confusing panel either it ricochet back and kill him or superman touched the man and he died either way golden age superman kill count clark want to continue with the vacation after that but lois want to rush back to metropolis for the story another day another kill for our beloved hero sometimes they try to make it not superman s fault and other time he s just a merciless killer annihilating people on a whim the hero of the people am i right this is the second comic in a short time that involves a poison gas that kill people but with war looming i guess they re trying to reference the last big war wwi and the gas attack that being said there were suddenly a lot of gas mask in this story did fireman and cop in have gas mask so easily on hand i know that now they do but it feel like that wouldn t be a thing quite yet also lois literally ran towards an explosion in a town full of poison gas not the sharpest reporter in the newsroom is she also also were clark and lois going on a country getaway to bang i mean it s and this is for kid so i don t think that wa the implication but in it certainly sound like they were going to i mean why else go to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere what are they going to do there read but no clark had to be jock blocked by a plot to steal poison gas for a foreign nation if i had a nickel every time that happened in a superman comic i d have a dime which isn t a lot but it s weird that it s happened twice

doctor strange multiverse of madness kamar taj scene wanda v kamar taj wa honestly the weakest part of the entire film if i m actually being honest probably one the worst action scene in the mcu the whole fight wa just wanda in the air firing her basic psionic blast amp telekinesis the other sorcerer just used magical canon amp arrow like seriously you d think a battle between a witch amp sorcerer would have a more creative battle than simple attack i don t even recall any spell being casted besides the shield thing doctor strange amp wong literally did not do anything they just stood there watching the sorcerer get killed while they just retreated inside doing nothing to help them if i wa making this movie i would ve had wanda conjure up some of those monster that she sent after america to attack kamar taj and actually have the sorcerer actually do something meaningful while wanda would face off against both wong amp strange instead of them being useless the whole time like they were also since i m already here why did strange keep america at kamar taj i know wanda had a way of tracking her wherever she wa but strange at least could ve delayed wanda reaching her by opening a portal to somewhere else after they lost the battle

can the green lantern ring make someone a living human so i m not very knowledgeable concerning the comic so if this wa clearly answered somewhere out there sorry for wasting your time the green lantern ring can make anything a long a the user can imagine it and ha the willpower to back up the creation and maintenance of it right so hypothetically a very strong user i e hal jorden who apparently beat the living incarnation of will that took the form of a whale wtf could create a human if they knew the in and out of our biology like if a powerful green lantern could imagine every human structure including the structure of a developed brain could they make someone if a world teir anthropologist the study of what make a human human got a ring could they construct a human with a conscious if they had the will to maintain him her while you re here i want to ask if the green lantern ring could make gas obviously they can make hard construction but they have also been shown to make liquid so what about gas also also there s the idea that the user depending on his strength of will can apply these so called property to their construct for example one user managed to apply the property of kryptonite to a rock like construct that actually affected superman uh wtf wa that cannon what doe that mean though
the dceu is confusing af can someone explain if it s still happening or what i know reef and pattinson s batman is in a different continuity a far a i understand it black adam shazam aquaman batgirl the flash and blue beetle all are taking place in the dceu apparently michael keaton is going to be batman in batgirl but i thought affleck wa the batman of the dceu affleck is also supposed to be in the flash a well a keaton so now i m very confused it feel like this universe should just reset with gal gadot s wonder woman from being the only thing canon thought

check out my spoiler free review of thor love and thunder http youtu be xw vkevify
gorr felt wasted on thor spoiler i know a bunch of people have already complained about thor love and thunder use of gorr but i ll post this anyway the most infuriating thing about this movie wa that gorr wa actually set up well his backstory wa changed to what in my opinion wa a far superior version however the rest of the movie completely disregarded this and made him a shallow and generally botched character until the end this character just felt wasted on a horribly excecuted rom com especially after character with far le potential were excecuted so well in the past lat seemed to randomly alter gorrs personality from discount voldemort to how he should have been excecuted depending on specific scene making his personality seem painfully botched

overanalyzing the crap out of loki and endgame the spoiler tag wa on you did it to yourself let s go in endgame thanos destroys the infinity stone and is subsequently killed by thor tony discovers time travel and they go to a separate timeline to get their infinity stone and snap everyone back which cause that universe s thanos to switch timeline and go to the universe we know about and die along with his whole army in the process of this action alternate dimension loki escape and his timeline is pruned by the tva leaving that loki alive however that timeline impacted the prime timeline it gave the avenger the infinity stone and gave tony emotional closure on his daddy issue at one point the tva wa entertaining two timeline in order to get the prime timeline on the correct path this ha weird implication though in the marvel universe deleting one timeline doesn t undo the memory that a timeline switcher might have tony having that nice moment with his dad still exists but his dad wa pruned this also mean that thanos had he waited any longer would have been pruned a well so here are some crazy implication dr strange s timeline where we win is true they might defeat thanos any number of way but there s one timeline where they don t get pruned all the character from timeline died and were recreated after the event of loki steve may have returned the infinity stone to a tilda swinton but not the tilda swinton that hulk got them from tony s dad wa pruned but an identical howard stark exists in the space where tony s second dad used to exist we can place the beginning of loki in but the end of season ha to be before the year in which endgame take place while the tva exists in the distant future or an alternate dimension or something the actual timeline split that occurs at the end of season ha to begin prior to this also implies that the timeline that steve go back to ha lost it infinity stone for another reason possibly to another group of avenger in another timeline this mean that there s a thanos surplus the tilda swinton donated their thanos for endgame then imploded resulting in a new timeline that also donated their thanos the tva made a bonus thanos for some other timeline to fight in some random way it could be the multiverse of madness thanos but it s definitely a violent thanos for some other dimension to deal with this doesn t matter that much but i wanted to make sense of some stuff in my head so i wrote it out

looking for a good dc comic podcasts that explains the universe hi everybody so i ve recently decided to jump into dc after mainly reading marvel for the last couple of year i m also someone that spends quite a lot of time listening to podcasts one i m especially fond of is marveling at marvel marvel for those that don t know the show an experienced comic reader pick each episode a marvel character and explains their history to someone who ha never touched a comic book it helped me very much in better understanding the universe a it wa quite overwhelming when i started reading now that i want to start with dc again i have the feeling there is a lot of background that i miss and a similar podcast could help me fill the gap i know the most important character and event i think but it d be great to get the bigger picture i ve been searching around but the only show i found were either not about the comic at all or more about the latest news if someone of you know a good show that is about explaining the universe and it history i d be very grateful

why doe marvel seem to be squandering their warhammer k license i wa intrigued when marvel took over the license for the wh k universe a couple of year ago i assumed they would make a real push for it in the way that they do with star war and to a lesser degree the alien predator franchise which they acquired around the same time if i recall correctly star war is a juggernaut of course but alien and predator are probably on par with wh k a far a fandom popularity go and they are getting plenty of title yet so far there s only been two short mini series marneus calgar and sister of battle in two year both were pretty decent i enjoyed them anyway and i keep checking preview for more k title but they aren t happening what s the deal k ha a rich lore heavy universe that just seems ripe to be explored and fleshed out in comic it s got a built in fan base in the people that play the tabletop game i used to for many year no time anymore and even more fan that just play the various video game i just assumed when marvel acquired the right that they were going to run with it and really build up a marvel k comic universe in the way that s never been done before or at least do a mini series for each of the different army faction so far though practically nothing doe anyone have any news or insight on why marvel just acquired the license but is now just sitting on it why would they bother is there something i don t know going on simply abandoned for low sale did i miss something i m baffled by the whole situation where are my wathammer comic dammit

i have a unpopular opinion about hulk that should be common knowledge i m tired of hearing this so here we go mark ruffalo s hulk look nothing like a ape hulk ha the same facial feature and bone anatomy a any human it s just that his skull structure is proportionally exaggerated yes hulk s brown ridge chin and upper lip are supposed to be over exaggerated hulk and jack kirby purposely made hulk like this because they took some inspiration from frankenstein s for hulk s physical design some people still say because of this he look like an ape and well anatomically that s still not true the whole skull of a gorilla differs from regular human amp hulk s skull for so many reason gorilla have a large sagittal crest on the top of their skull which give them the cone head appearance hulk doesn t have a gorilla cone head lol hulk s skull shape is the same a a human just slightly sloped and the brown ridge is larger gorilla have proportionately big canine teeth but hulk doesn t his teeth are usually portrayed a being proportionally smaller than regular human in comparison to his overall face gorilla have prognathism giving them a protruding face but hulk doesn t have that his upper lip is longer than the average human s but his face is still flat like a human and doesn t protrude extremely gorilla have receding chin but hulk s chin is pronounced the only thing that you could say is ape like about hulk are his mannerism but that s comic accurate

what exactly are the repercussion of final crisis spoiler i ve just finished the book dc essential edition if you re curious and i m just very confused a to why it s called a crisis nothing universal in scale wa ultimately altered unless you count the death of batman i won t lie the last issue especially felt very all over the place and i wa pretty much confused the entire way through it but i enjoyed all other six at least to me it felt inconsequential by the end superman had wished for the universe to be put together and aside from batman being killed everything seems like it wa put back to normal by the end maybe i m missing something coie ended with all universe bar one being destroyed zero hour ended with parallax essentially winning and displacing time infinite crisis ended with the multiverse coming back and final crisis what exactly maybe i m just being really stupid and missed something i admittedly did feel myself zoning out quite a bit by the th issue but i wa just wondering if someone could explain to me what impact final crisis exactly had

i just read secret war by itself liked it just fine you get the gist of a lot of the character s motivation and characteristic even if you haven t read any of the leadup story i standby the statement that to enjoy most of marvel s comic you really only have to know who character are and what they re classification is to at the very least understand what is happening at least that s what a good marvel story is in my opinion i think reading secret war a the conclusion to hickman s other work is definitely a worthy payoff but reading it on it s own is still a good story
how batman villain become popular gonna be honest i think the lack of a proper batman animated series is kinda stifling his pool of villain at the moment but another problem related to that is that memorable batman villain have to be simultaneously threatening and able to appear in a child s cartoon villain like joker and riddler both have prominent silly and serious appearance whereas villain like professor pyg had to be changed into completely different character it s why the fuller rogue gallery hasn t been getting a much attention a of late only new one from the s were hush and red hood and the only one from past that wa the court of owl now i personally think that some character like mr bloom or peacekeeper could get some more exposure if adapted right maybe even mr worth who would y all like to see become more prominent

do you guy think that dc will ever do a crisis on infinity earth in movie form seeing how dc is picking thing from past movie and retcon them into the dceu and at the same time doing many story that take place in other universe across cinema tv and streaming so they are in a very similar situation a dc comic wa in the early s with lot of different content in diffetent universe and a bagage of old not anymore running content so in the case that all of these stuff creates so mutch confusion that it hurt the brand do you think they will do a massive event that involves all the movie and tv show dceu joker the batman cw and even older movie a we have seen with keaton they don t care if something is not currently running or treanding like crisis on infinite earth wa and after doing this epic multiversal story the end product will be a single cohesive earth with only the favourite part from all dc live action in this earth with a shared past and also little thing they want to expand on i m not saying this is a bad idea or good just asking because i love the comic and i see that dc is already keen to use the multiverse to change the status quo to avoid brand controversy or confusion so regardless of story potential or repsect of the autor i think that if all of this many universe many story will start to fail they will take the best stuff and take away the worst or what they think it is and if they do i hope they adapt this realy fun story
visual identity for dc character ex dick grayson romani representation tl dr how much can you change about a character before they are not that character anymore is their entire physical appearance up for grab a long a their story and action are not altered amp x b hey all i have been seeing a lot of passionate discussion about valid representation of character in particular dick grayson in regard to their cultural heritage v canonical traditional depiction i wa curious to gather some wider opinion on the matter rather than just the one i ve been seeing in the last three post regarding gabriel larrag n s artwork mainly how important is a character s visual identity compared to their identity a a whole i think the discussion in those aforementioned thread wa becoming very racial in nature so i wanted to point some thing out and find out how others feel i think in comic book especially the superhero persona give a lot of freedom in term of the expression of the pedestrian alter ego for example while bruce wayne is usually depicted a tall and muscular there is a variety in his actual build over time you have frank miller and ben affleck portrayal where bruce is very built and you have christian bale and david mazzucchelli depiction where he ha a leaner build so at what point do we stop recognizing the character a bruce wayne a lot of people are saying that you can t change dick grayson from white or white passing to more visually representative of a romani an indo aryan ethnicity with asian root heritage if you take that stance then why doesn t it apply to other physical trait the difference in build i listed above or let s go further is hair color an acceptable change is hair color a bigger part of identity than build often artist depiction of dark hair character will range from brown to black is ezra miller s flash a objectionable a a darker complexion dick grayson shouldn t actor dye their hair or wear wig to better match the source material going back to ethnicity ca cain is canonically biracial i recognize that s different than being th romani when romani people can also just be white passing i also recognize that is significantly more nuanced than simple skin tone but i would say her artistic depiction have a pretty wide range from very asian to very white i think basically the point i m trying to make is that it s easy to say a character can be depicted any way you want or a character ha to be depicted a they are traditionally within the cannon at the same time if it is just a matter of wanting better representation isn t it not more preferable to create brand new character

thought on the end of grant morrison s batman a lot of people view the end of gm amazing run on batman a bleak and depressing i don t think it is i get that batman is stuck in an ouroborus of lonliness and struggle against evil but i don t understand why he cannot be happy doing it it s much like sisyphus from albert camus myth of sisyphus sisyphus is trapped in a cycle not unlike batman yet camus encourages his audience to imagine sisyphus happy and if i ve learned anything from gm work it s that imagination is more important than reality batman may be alone at the end of the story but he won t be alone forever i believe he can grow with his peer maybe he will grow he still ha dick gordon and alfred even though he sends him on vacay i believe the end of morrison s run show that even though evil will always exist so will the idea of u our myth we can create meaning in the cycle of struggle and meaninglessness we can move forward together

why the mcu need silk i personally don t really like spiderman but the mcu movie of him are awesome i saw there wa a cliffhanger where spiderman still exists in the mcu after no way home and it left me confused if sony doesn t want marvel to play with spiderman anymore why have him still alive in their world then i thought of silk cindy moon a pretty sure latino woman who wa the second person bit by the same spider that bit peter parker maybe for one last hurrah from tom holland s spiderman there could be a disney miniseries where he meet and train cindy before he retires or something cindy moon would have latino and female representation and the added bonus of being not only a kickass but also spiderman

fun fact the japanese spider man series led to the creation of power ranger under a year licensing deal with toei company yes that toei who s animation company make such great a dragon ball sailor moon and one piece the next series they produced following supaidaman wa battle fever j it is now known a the rd super sentai series but back then it wa considered the first ignoring the creation of shotaro ishinomori that were himitsu sentai goranger and jakq dengekitai due to licensing right shotaro ishinomori also created kamen rider a sister series to super sentai both of which continue to this day and are part of a genre called tokusatsu which not only includes superhero production but kaiju movie such a godzilla and gamera battle fever j wa also the first sentai series to feature a giant robo mecha or what we in the west know a a zord megazord with the success of battle fever j and the other marvel produced show denshi senttai denjiman and taiyo sentai sun vulcan the super sentai franchise wa able to continue a it doe to this day haim saban while in japan on a business trip spotted the th th at the time super sentai series choudenshi bioman on tv he wa like i can make money off of this by dubbing it over and so year later in filming for the american segment of the first season of mighty morphin power ranger began taking stock footage from the th th at the time super sentai series kyoryu sentai zyuranger fun fact stan lee also saw a sentai series whilst in japan one time but when he brought it to the network they turned it down so somewhere in this ever expanding multiverse there s a world where stan lee created power ranger and it wa created way before the s anyway the suit stuck for the next two season with the only element they took from the consecutive sentai being the mecha from gosei sentai dairanger and ninja sentai kakuranger for season and respectively a well a the white ranger suit coming from dairanger the alien ranger of aquitar were also adapted from the kakurangers for the most part power ranger ha continued to adapt from sentai although not entirely in order and jumping around a bit in recent year tl dr the japanese spider man series wa part of a licensing deal with marvel that sparked super sentai season which helped boost the already rapidly growing popularity so much that haim saban saw it in japan and year later took footage from these series legally of course to dub over and create power ranger
m marvel ep theory what you seek is seeking you kamala need her grandmother and great grandmother to figure out everything but they also need kamala since kamala time travel back she s probably the one who made trail of star to help her grandmother and aisha disappeared because she time traveled to future with kamala what do you guy think
discussion guy everything is canon is not meant to be taken so literally it just mean that most story happened in some way shape or form regardless of the timeline don t think about the inconsistency just make your own headcanon on how all the event occurred don t worry about age and just focus on age group seriously you guy are gonna hurt yourselves thinking so hard about this
do we take canon a bit too seriously here in a world where continuity is a jumbled mess and stuff it really feel like lot of people are eager to hate certain character for stuff they did in like one issue i just don t really feel like we should be the morality police for these fictional character that aren t always required to make the right choice it s not up to the writer to write morally pure character that live up to the audience expectation
which nightwing comic do i get taylor to sign i can only get signed due to money i m leaning towards first appearance of heartless or the mystery behind melinda zucco any thought

my random question natasha this is by no mean at the top of my wishlist but what do u think the chance r of another natasha appearance in the mcu my thought would be it s possible because of her soul stone sacrifice she could be anything an evil zombie mercenary assistant for red skull or maybe even become the new stone protector and red skull come back to life since he served his duty i m not stuck in the past i m glad we r going heavier cosmic but we all know hollywood and that she ended on a crappy note a lot of people r still bothered about totally random i know
villain that should ve stayed hero so a i read through the backlog of marvel in the early s i wa reminded of the time juggernaut went straight a a hero with the x men which reminded me of all the time magneto did a well or when doctor doom did for infamous iron man or mystique s solo series or you get the idea ha there ever been a villain who briefly wa a heroic character that you wished had stayed heroic be it because you thought they were a more interesting character a a hero or because the slide back into villainy wa unconvincing or unsatisfying

multiverse question doe anyone else get the feeling that marvel s phase ha no underlying structure w r t what they are doing with the multiverse it seems like each series movie reinvents the multiverse idea for something different and none of it is tying together in any way loki break the multi verse look like that is the starting point then spider man nwh doesn t reference what happened there and doe it own thing with the multiverse then it end within the scope of the movie then what if doe it own version of the multiverse and close the loop on it the same thing happens in dr strange mom but it feel even more disconnected the only thing that seems to have an open thread at this point is loki and i still don t know if that s the same multiverse we see in these other entry or something entirely different this is very different from phase and phase who had very brief connective tissue but it at least told an overarching story

stuff that caught my attention from last week ama with joshua williamson potential spoiler below q how old is connor hawke now he seems to have his pre flashpoint memory intact but seems younger a in my mind hawke is in his late teen early twenty maybe a bit older but i think for the sake of the timeline he might be a bit younger you know that story where he and kyle and wally went on a cruise i always felt like hawke wa intended to be the youngest of the three q is there any chance you guy doing a new secret file and origin event or a new history of the dc universe book anytime soon to help get folk up to speed on current continuity a i would love to work on new history of the dcu maybe that s something we need after dark crisis q if black adam s story from is canon for dark crisis then how doe the history work for billy batson and his family the post crisis pre flashpoint history and the new rebirth history just don t seem compatible together new billy doesn t believe that pure hearted people exist so having even vague memory of being someone considered to be pure of heart should shatter his world view a gt yup you re right keep reading lt q i m very curious if you were able to find room for a stephanie brown and kara bff scene that you mentioned you might write on a livestream a i m still trying to find a place for steph and kara to hang out but i think i know where just won t be in something i m writing q why would jon go to jace before any of the bat family member with a thousand time more experience a jon wa fan casting haha sort of jon did talk to nightwing and nightwing said his peace on the idea of a new justice league so when jon went to build out a roster he wanted to go to the next batman a i think he thought maybe he could relate

how dc ha treated tim over the year is shameful so after eleven year tim drake is finally getting an ongoing series but even a a longtime tim drake fan i am just not excited at all and that is mainly because of how dc ha handled and treated tim over the past decade he wa one of the best character in the batfamily post crisis in my opinion the reason why he wa so great wa because of his growth a a character going from robin to red robin however ever since the new he s ha struggled to stay relevant he got put into a teen titan book that nobody read or liked his origin got retconned everything that wa great about the character felt like it wa stripped away i assume this wa all dan didio s handiwork in rebirth in james tynion s run on detective a lot of what he lost in the new got restored somewhat like his origin his relationship with steph but during james tynion s run he wa also killed off and wa therefore sidelined for awhile when you wanted to see mire of him after that he started appearing in young justice in which bendis started hyping up his new identity which i wa also pretty excited for fan came up with so many name but the result wa so disappointing then after that series got cancelled he just stayed in limbo for awhile making sporadic appearance here and there this is something that ha happened with him a lot ever since his solo got cancelled in new and it s so frustrating for a fan to see his favorite character just disappear from comic altogether then we got the urban legend story which wa controversial some of people liked it some people hated it i personally didn t have a problem with it the only problem i have with it wa how they ended his relationship with steph if it actually meant he would get more spotlight and attention from dc but after that story came out there wa a lot of month of just absolutely nothing he fell into a limbo again finally the solo series wa eventually announced and the choice of the writer really doesn t make me wanna read it the recently released young justice issue wa quite bad with many character written out of character and the pride special wasn t great either i really want the series to be good but i just don t think it s going to be i hope that his relationship with barnard doesn t take priority over him being a superhero because at the end of the day it s a series about a superhero and him being a superhero should take priority above all else
why did the watcher allow natasha to switch universe i know the simple answer is that rule wasn t written yet but still why did the watcher allow the black widow to switch into a new universe since it will surely cause an incursion sooner or later im rewatching d and reed say the larger the footprint a person who is not supposed to be in a different universe leaf behind the higher likelihood of an incursion yet at the end of what if the watcher transport natasha from the ultron universe into a universe that lost their natasha this would cause an incursion no

is amora the marvel equivalent to jarnsaxa we ve seen all the big figure of the norse mitology depicted in the marvel universe in a more or le recognizable way odin loki sif badler etc i know that are there a lot of different sotries and interpretionts that contradict eachother but loki is a liar and thor s frenemie sif is a warrior and had a romantic relationship with thor more or le all the character and concept exists in a similar way of the mainsteam image of them all except one jarnsaxa jarnsaxa is a forst giant that becomes thor s lover ha child with him and survives the ragnarok and awaits with her child in yggdrasil until the end of the world obviously we haven t seen this character in the mu but we ve seen a character with a very similar role amora the enchantress even there is an alternate universe where she ha this exact story so what do you think so you think amora is essentialy jarnsaxa and marvel see her this way do you think a more explicit statement is necessary to cement this in the lore

am i missing something about spider gwen s age i ve been around for year so i understand that marvel ha a pretty strong inclination towards keeping character at stagnant age forever it doesn t surprise me that gwen hasn t got that much older but i wa starting gwenverse today and it call her a teenager that cannot be possible can it am i missing something in her original run mile called her and then she spent a year in prison after that even if we assume no other time ha passed over the course of several crossover and an entire run of her comic despite time passing for the rest of the marvel universe shouldn t she be at least are they really just that insistent on de aging her to line up with the movie or is there something that i missed

some deconstruction of dc comic rated based on if they had anything interesting to say there are so many it s almost always superman or the justice league but i ve read and watched quite a few so here are some of the more popular one this is my opinion this is not objective truth art doesn t have objective truth some people pay million for a green block others pay penny for intricate chinese woven painting the world is weird harley quinn what if harley had complex emotion and we dredged up a bunch of random underused supervillains and made them tremendously dysfunctional i dig it it doesn t immediately go dc but dark it go dc but chaotic and i respect that the actual moral seems to be about gaining a sense of self worth which isn t a bad way to go at all the watchman the moral seems to be when you get too big and powerful you lose track of the most important part of life remake don t always focus on that a much though and instead focus on how cool rorsach is and to be fair rorsach is very cool it s been added into dc comic now so it s not even a dc parody anymore it s just a dc thing the boy seems to be a statement about corporation dehumanizing individual for a profit good character and the show ha a very different trajectory than the comic but neither suck solid justice league parody the character are aesthetically the justice league and when you first see them they look like the justice league but a the story progress they veer so far off that it becomes a totally different work invincible what if superman wa evil aaaand killed the justice league the concept isn t mind blowing but evil superman training his son is a decent premise for a story about lot of gore and angst man of steel what if superman had to kill somebody asks the guy who forgot what superman s whole deal wa we jumped into a theoretical superman s darkest hour while neither developing the character nor dealing with the consequence of that choice decent opening act though brightburn what if superman wa evil wouldn t that be bad yes it would literally nobody is questioning whether an evil superman would be a bad thing they tried to tease an evil justice league series too very ambitious for a show with the most simple question and answer ever the eyeball scene wa gross
krakoa x men are mutant supremacist the way i read x men comic is by switching human and mutant with real world equivalent like english and south irish or japanese and chinese if william stryker say death to all mutant and say it god will for human to exterminate them all switch human with japanese with human and chinese with mutant and ot doesn t sound right if magneto is spouting about human are superior and human should serve be ruled by their new master then replace mutant with white and human with black and it doesn t sound right can t wait till krakoa end in flame

thor need to stop being comedic thor love and thunder just like ragnarok i found to be full of bad comedy that not even a year old would laugh at there wa perhaps or decent joke in there the comedy expertise of taika waititi is doing the thor character more damage than good by turning him back into the moron he wa at the beginning of thor in thor there wa an interesting and serious arc where thor went from a proud and idiotic prince to a much more sensible and caring hero recent movie have turned thor into at best a moron and at worst a joke thor in my opinion also had better presentation than ragnarok the visuals of asgard in the opening of thor were brilliant and truly portrayed asgard a a realm of god and hero while ragnarok simply lack the awe inspiring golden glory of asgard and make it seem more like just another cool planet recent movie have not done thor any favor it wa clear that kenneth branagh had a much more vivid picture of asgard and he wa able to very beautifully translate that picture into film in my opinion taika waititi specialises in comedy and his intentionally funny movie are absolutely amazing but the thor character wa not supposed to be funny therefore i feel that he wa the wrong choice for this movie franchise and that marvel either need to tone down the comedy or bring back kenneth branagh i didn t hate love and thunder but i found it to be a bit mediocre it had very good aspect to it but there are a lot of way in which it could be improved and i hope that thor and any of his future movie improve on this
when dr doom hit the mcu should the mask come off in recent show we have seen backlash from fan when character take off a mask that usually in the comic or source material kept them on should dr doom be a darth vader type and just leave the mask on once it s established who he is a a villian i m sure there will be a back story where we get to see the face of the actor doing the role but once doom is in full costume should his mask ever come off

which hero would be in the top most popular superheroes in dc world we know that superman is the greatest superhero of all time in that world objectively the universe pretty much moved around him so he is the obvious no i don t think batman would be that popular in the dc world a much a irl since he spend most of his time fighting in gotham and people seems to know that he didn t really have any special superpower he is still very popular of course but i don t think he would be no or most popular material i think no at most if batman isn t the nd wonder woman is the obvious choice being the greatest female superhero and all that the flash barry allen would be no i think he is the only hero that ha his own museum other hero just used hall of justice or jsa hall and also ha his own flash day which hero do you think is popular enough to be among top in the dc world in universe
whats the point in prolonging mutant kind i am reading xmen v avenger and something that is resonating again in more modern comic is the idea of not just protecting the mutant race but to keep it going it like they dont care if mutant population dy what they actually want is for mutant race not to go extinct going to the extent of allowing the phoenix force to take over for the possibility of bringing back mutant and other crazy bat shit stuf even nightcrawler suggest everyone start having sex because there need to be more mutant whats the point whats the point of just making super powered baby which kill at least person by mistake by the time they are in high school

i need to know what to read now since i have finished harley quinn rebirth series i know she ha an infinite frontier series but am i supposed to read something in between the i have the joker war saga and i think that take place in between i used to be up to date with all the dc comic but i stopped reading a few year ago and just finished harley s rebirth series and im slowly working through the batgirl one a well i am extremely overwhelmed any help would be great
my somewhat comprehensive reading order i got back into reading comic about a year ago and wa a bit overwhelmed i got the dc infinite app and tried jumping into various book of character i loved it wa frustrating always feeling like i wa missing context and background and so i began researching various reading order i eventually stumbled on mikesamazingworld com they have a catalogue of every dc book released and their cover i decided i would start at crisis on infinite earth and go from there i read through the dc infinite compilation and then plugged in the date at the end to mike somewhere around too lazy to check forgive me and sorted by publication date i read about of the title from each month skipping one that arent on the app or that dont really interest me ill read one go back to the mike page and find the next im at the tale end of and having a great time reading some lesser known run or old classic ive missed it a big undertaking but i have enjoyed myself immensely and reccomend this to anyone looking for a big project how do you pick what to read aside from grabbing current title do you think im crazy thought in general i have loved reading the old question run and brynes superman stuff a it s all fresh to me recent favorite are the old peacemaker miniseries and sword of the atom way late to the oarty but perez wonder woman is great too

going to read all of supermanfrom the epic meltdown over gay city http www reddit com r dccomics comment vabspq im going to read all of supermanfrom the http www reddit com r dccomics comment vabspq im going to read all of supermanfrom the superman story there is an epidemic of crime in metropolis and they are all dope addict shooting in the street almost kill both lois and some child the dealer however ha a good lawyer that always get them off superman lure them into a trap by catching them red handed trying to steal morphine the slimy lawyer get them off clark then attends a party at one of their house and catch them murdering an accomplice they attempt to burn the body but superman grab them stuff them in a van crushing the door and then call the cop all are arrested this is a really short description mostly because the comic itself is very generic it barely interest me considering the sheer insanity of all the one that came before it superman throwing them in a deliver van and then crushing the end of it so they can t escape wa kind of cool but other than that there s just a lot of talking and not a lot of action not all comic are going to be winner i suppose action comic cover date january clark get a call about a man threatening to jump off a bridge he charge there a superman and save him only for the man to tell him that he gambled away all his money at the preston club superman then treatens the man s life not to committ suicide because that s how it work and decides to investigate the preston club a clark he go with the mayor to said club but it appears to be just a gentleman s club in the traditional sense not the modern one you pervs afterwards however clark overhears that the mayor is being blackmailed lois decides to go on her own and promptly get discovered and drugged preston sends men to kill clark but superman beat them down and head to the club finding lois wandering outside in a daze it turn out she took a drug to make her lose all her memory although doctor can do nothing clark us his hypnotic vision to bring her out of it uh i mean okay clark then build a krypto raygun which is basically something that can take picture and then shine them on a wall like a projector superman get the picture of the gambling bust down the door and beat everyone up preston run to the mayor s office where lois is already it turn out preston gave the memory wiping drug to the mayor s son and say he won t cure him if the mayor arrest him the mayor however ha had enough and refuse to help preston preston then kidnaps them both meanwhile superman us his hypnosis power to cure the mayor s son superman then chase them down save the car from running off and cliff and brings preston to the police the mayor is worried that he ll be ruined but clark say he ll be just fine since he ll testify that the mayor is being blackmailed which apparently excuse everything he did oh boy back to insanity okay i don t know where superman learned to save suicidal people but apparently they didn t teach him logic threatening a suicidal man with death is not gonna work they re already suicidal like huh then the mayor is involved with a racketeering scandal and also helped cover it up i don t think the whole yeah but my son is really going to help him here if something like that happens you re supposed to call the police if someone kidnapped your son and forced you to commit crime you re still on the hook for those crime plus the mayor is also really stupid like what motivation doe the crook have to cure your son he s just going to string you along forever finally and apparently superman can build sci fi nonsense device and ha the ability to counter act drug that destroy people s brain good power to have i guess action comic cover date february a lumber magnate change his will to turn a lumber forest into a summer camp for boy after he dy and then he promptly and mysteriously dy the brother of said magnate contest the will saying that his brother wa insane at the time of writing the will but he loses the case several month later the revenue from the company ha dried up because of sabotage that ha killed the worker lois and clark decide to head out to the forest to pretend to look for job when they arrive on the site the evil overseer who doe not look like the man from those brawny paper towel commercial i assure you say he ll put them to work later however the brawny man tell the boatman working for the company to dump lois overboard the boatman doe so and lois is swept out into a whirlpool in the lake in vivid color that are um totally not the color of a lake clark however sens that something is wrong he fly over a superman and rescue her in vivid color again lois come to but the brawny man lock them both in a cabin clark us hypnosis to stun lois and leap from the cabin with them both he then turn into superman and spring to action and follows the brawny man back to the head office naturally at this point lois come to and try to sneak in only to get kidnapped a she usually doe the guy in the head office wearing a mask however pull out a gun and kill both the brawny man and the boatman superman then barge in a piece of wood flying through the air catch one of the bullet and ricochet back into the masked man head that s not how bullet work to the surprise of no one it is revealed that it is the brother of the magnate who also killed his brother and tried to sabotage the company so he could buy it up for cheap you know normally i don t talk about the artwork it s mostly because it s all uniform and the same i mean so far it s been drawn by the same people over and over again this time however i just have to mention that they way they drew the lake wa objectively gorgeous like when lois and superman were under the water there were these intricate pattern of color swirling around them lois wa also striking some dramatic pose with her clothes and hair floating around her it looked like a renaissance painting something that should be hung in a museum i m not a guy who really like are or anything but definitely check this one out and see what i mean that being said that s not what water look like you don t go underwater and see a flippin rainbow of color like a giant who ate a bag of skittle threw up in it also i know this is a comic book and it ha a loose interpretation of physic but if you shoot wood the bullet will not bounce back like what kind of wood are they chopping down at this lumberyard we should be making tank out of that and not steel i m not even sure why they bothered even giving the brother a mask a anyone over the age of three with a grasp on object permanence could tell it wa him whatever i m not dc comic what do i know

if earth is to galactus a a big mac is to a normal man galactus would still only be a tall a the sun sometimes when i think about galactus i think it s stupid how huge he is sometimes portrayed a being that he could hold the whole earth in his hand that would make him incredibly large but after seeing a picture of the earth compared to the sun it got me pondering just how huge the universe really is so i did some math to figure out how galactus would compare to the sun if he could literally eat the earth like a big mac i know he usually us machine to convert the planet to energy but i ve still seen him portrayed a big enough to actually eat them here s the math a big mac is inch tall according to google assuming a foot man this put a man at big mac tall the earth s diameter is approximately mile so if big mac man earth galactus we should multiply earth s diameter by to find galactus height that yield mile a g s height the sun s diameter is mile that is almost exactly time the height we calculated for galactus so while he would still be enormous don t get me wrong galactus would still be dwarfed by the sun i don t know why this wa interesting to me but i hope it wa for you too sometimes it s just cool to think about how huge our universe really is here are some bonus comparison at this scale compared to galactus the moon would be the size of a skittle saturn would be about his height uy scuti the largest known star ha a diameter so large that even at galactus scale it would be nearly mile long

what if all the robin were a single person who had a huge character arc this is just a thought that i had but i always found it weird that batman had multiple robin which is to say that multiple different people took on the vigilante persona of robin starting with dick grayson who wa then replaced by jason todd who wa then replaced by tim drake who wa then replaced by damian wayne while i know the meta reason this happened wa to keep the dynamic robin had with batman fresh and interesting a well a give room for various robin to grow out of the role and into their own people it still just never sat right with me i almost saw it a batman essentially shopping for a new robin once his old one had moved on which just seems wrong while i know that s a bit of an oversimplification that doesn t do the context of each new robin recruitment justice it s still how i feel thus i wa wondering what other people think about the idea of all the various robin dick jason tim and damian being one character while that might sound a little unclear here s sort of what i had in mind this single unified robin would be the assassin son of batman and talia al ghul and would slowly gain humanity via becoming robin a vigilante sidekick to his father later deciding in spite of this that the joker wa too evil for any kind of mercy unlike the rest of the rogue and thus attempting to put him down for good only to fail and get beaten to death later being revived by a lazarus pit due to being the grandson of ra s al ghul becoming mentally disturbed and returning to gotham in order to kill all the criminal including the joker being stopped by his father who would help him move past his trauma in the aftermath deciding to leave gotham behind in favor of finding a new purpose in his life due to all he had been through eventually teaming up with other young vigilante sidekick and deciding to create a superhero team with them known a the titan a he spent time with them his broken soul would mend back together figuratively and literally and he would become a healthy mature young man taking on the moniker of nightwing and becoming a much more upbeat and hopeful superhero instead of a glum and serious one so a you can see this hypothetical single unified robin is basically an amalgamation of all the different robin put into a single character that go on what is surprisingly enough a pretty good character arc that fit together rather nicely thought

i think m marvel went a little hard on the islam i mean i like the show a lot and will continue to like it i d call it the most visually stunning disney marvel show and it s not close the villain look comparatively bland but whatever i think we ve now reached the point of trying too hard to talk about islam though we had a speech about muslim headwear a wedding a discussion about different social group and all the while i didn t really question it because i m american and islam is a minority religion but then i imagined what it would be like if it wa christian they talk about the seating and construction of the church a the preacher give a lesson then the very wise preacher offer sage advice to the protagonist she go out and doe one super thing and the fed immediately know that she s christian the non christian friend read the torah for clue on her superpower and then they go to a wedding in a church where they say a prayer and do communion afterwards the heroine even overhears the preacher giving perfect advice to others that happens to apply perfectly to her i m not upset by the amount of time dedicated to islam or anything since it is a long running show but i don t think it s specifically necessary to go into such detail about character s religious belief in a franchise where we ve already confirmed two objectively correct religion the norse and egyptian pantheon i watch scene about islam and wonder why nobody told them about that time the skeleton bird god and crocodile goddess had a fistfight in cairo i don t think it s meant to be tragic but it feel a tragic a when captain america said there wa only one god back in

after seeing doctor strange mom do you believe marvel will ever give u a mcu version apparently illuminati it wa great seeing the illuminati in mom especially reed and xavier but the whole takeaway of that film from my reading being that our strange is the sort of ultimate version the strangest strange if you will seemed to imply that he would never stoop to such ethically dubious decision making a his multiversal counterpart that let the pressure get to them on the other hand however the fact that the mcu is bringing in this new batch of younger hero seems to hint at a future schism amongst the marvel hero ala the comic story where the young avenger grow disillusioned with their legacy counterpart increasingly unethical and anti heroic action kamala khan in particular is a huge part of this story a are wiccan and speedball plus our peter parker is still young inexperienced enough despite having already participated in a universal war he is still very much in his friendly neighborhood phase to take the mile morale role of that story honesty kamala in particular with her avenger hero worship seems to be tailor made for this role of being the true believer that ha finally lost faith eventually a seen in the recent fluster cluck that wa the ea avenger game counterpoint to the counterpoint marvel seems very unwilling to make their top billed mcu character take on a le than heroic persona wanda being some kinda dirty in mom notwithstanding a evidenced by the nixing of stark s infamous demon in a bottle story now this point may be the weakest a i m sure many fan can and likely will point out how dumb i am for forgetting the myriad example of mcu hero acting in an anti heroic manner but it seemed worth pointing out regardless i d love to hear other fan thought on this a it would be great to see an mcu prime illuminati one day if only because i won t be able to die happy until i ve seen mark ruffalo get a world war hulk story so we can see world breaker hulk in the mcu

so what potential ally do they have left the entire green lantern corp is gone confirmed dead in issue we also know that all big hitter of the justice league are either dead or turned into vampire the only real big hitter that the human s have are supergirl doctor fate martian manhunter and constantine every other person there is pretty much fodder and can get taken out easily the only other potential ally i can see is perhaps releasing all the kryptonians in the phantom zone and letting them take out a much vampire a possible hell see if you can get the eradicator on your side

why wa jai and irey west in the dark multiverse and not in the speed force like all the other speedster it just doesn t make sense when jay and bart were in it but not the twin
which movie are you most excited for view poll http www reddit com poll vkjfqj
theory the mcu is a franchise within the comic universe watching the boy gave me an idea it wa established in multiverse of madness that the main mcu is earth meaning it is part of it own multiverse and it ha no relation to the comic america chavez s existence basically confirms this since there is supposed to only be one of her and yet there is both a movie and comic version in the boy there are movie based on all of the superheroes that are clearly not accurate to what really happened in my theory the mcu is a franchise of movie and show created in the actual comic universe the x men franchise and other non mcu marvel movie were other attempt from different studio to adapt all the character but the mcu is the most successful one even though it is not very faithful to how event really happened in the comic which is real life to them it would also be made a decade or two in the future from where the marvel comic universe is now to explain how filmmaker know thing that they shouldn t such a spider man s identity since it is very much possible that people eventually learn of these thing it would be like all those bio pic about real people that get made in real life but not very faithful to what really happened people in the marvel universe would wanna make movie and show about their real life hero they probably sell insanely well
the g future state initiative should have been centered around the young justice generation i know a lot of g wa grafted on the idea that jon wa too old for supersons and damian would go down to be the big bad of the whole event which make sense why he isn t batman but instead of jumping through hole for placement like creating new character for the initiative why didn t they use the character they already had we ve seen a lot of dick a batman but we really haven t seen a lot of tim a batman but not evil i would have loved to see that especially right now when the yj generation is being treated like the middle child of dc connor cassie and bart weren t even in future state g should have been an initiative to push the younger hero they already had tim a batman damian a robin eternal conor a superman jon a superboy and that would have been perfect
miss my comic i see a lot of people sharing old comic on here here s my story so i began collecting comic when i wa seven my grandparent owned a small variety store and every weekend i d go work saturday and sunday it wa menial task such a stock the can wipe down shelving stack newspaper but every time i d finish my grandmother would let me pick one comic a chocolate milk and a chocolate bar so over a year i d collected quite a few and this went on for five plus year but when i wa ten i d gone to my other grandparent with my father and my uncle wa cleaning junk out of his old room i use junk a a loose term here a he had milk crate full of comic from the late sixty early seventy i asked if i could have them hand he said yup and gave them all to me so by the time i wa ten i had s of comic and mostly marvel some of the comic i had were avenger incredible hulk fantastic four first time with dr doom spider man first time with the punisher for that i had the original and the reprint from the s anyways all of these comic were in bag with cardboard backing and at least were in fair to good shape we ll fast forward twenty year and my basement flood while my wife and i are gone on vacation those comic by the time we got home were destroyed and by destroyed i mean mulch in the plastic bag they d basically just deteriorated into nothingness contact my insurance company and they told me without proof of the price of them they could only give me the bottom price on all pretty sure i wa sitting on approx k worth of comic and ended up getting k for the insurance money and that included other property that got ruined i miss my comic so thanks for sharing yours it make me very nostalgic
which black knight run should i start with i am dying to get into the black knight comic i loved his appearance in eternals and i also happen to mod a subreddit about the character r danewhitman i am using this subreddit to help me learn more about the character there are different solo run of black knight that i am considering but i would like your opinion on which is the better starting point the fall of dane whitman by frank tieri or curse of the ebony blade by simon spurrier
saw thor love and thunder spoiler i know the movie wa supposed to be more comedic so i ll avoid commenting about the actual content of how it wa portrayed what i m going to take issue with is some of the plot hole that presented themselves i ll attach a spoiler tag but allow me to also provide another spoiler warning jane using mjolnir i m fine with her using mjolnir to become a thor but the fact that she us a broken mjolnir at all raise some question the piece called to her and the movie itself admitted that the piece were immovable this mean that they maintained the enchantment to only be moved by the worthy which is explained away by thor having mjolnir protect her my issue stand with that she can move and operate the hammer a if it never were destroyed with the exception of being able to break it apart on command thor then is able to lift the hammer in it reassembled state so when hela destroyed it why did he act like his weapon wa gone forever the piece were right there clearly still enchanted and able to be reformed and wielded by him did the hammer decide it didn t like thor anymore he had to forge stormbreaker because his hammer wa broken but jane wa able to just pick up the piece and use them why didn t he did he just decide that the hammer wasn t worth using anymore wish granting eternity the movie establishes that thor know that eternity exists heck even valkyrie knew about it granted you need the bifrost to get there so thor wouldn t have been able to access eternity until the end of infinity war but directly after the snap thanos destroys the infinity stone and retires thor show up and pop his head off all well and good wouldn t this be the perfect time to go and wish everyone back the stone are gone thanos is dead there is apparently no one guarding eternity unless gorr killed the guard off screen which even if he did i m sure the remaining hero post snap could probably handle any resistance thor could go in and wish everyone back wish thanos never snapped or really any number of counter wish instead thor wait year because he forgot he didn t feel like it would rather partake in time travel shenanigan thor can grant thor power i wa under the impression that jane wa using mjolnir a the source of her thor power but apparently thor can just grant his power to anyone not even a single person either he can grant his power to just over a dozen child he did specify that it wa temporary but it felt like it wa because he didn t want super powered kid running around not out of lack of ability to give them permanently wa thor only able to do this because he held the bolt how did he know the bolt could do this why did the bolt work for him at all you would think someone like zeus would have a similar worthy enchantment on his greatest weapon or at the very least a only function for me enchantment so i ll assume thor can just hand these ability out willy nilly i know shooter mcpokeysticks and redhead twistythighs would certainly benefit from some thor power even if he can only do it temporarily why not give everyone a thor boost before battle i have other issue but these three seemed like the largest glaring problem that contradict other lore already set up by the other movie i m curious what you folk think or if you have theory on how why these plot hole actually work thanks for reaching the end of my rant

james gunn didn t do the gotg justice i m gonna preface this by saying i actually like most of jame s work suicide squad peacemaker although i think that show had some major flaw and i actually think the guardian movie pretty decent a a fun turn off your brain watch that being said i have some major issue with the way james characterizes the guardian right off the bat let s all agree that drax and groot aren t even really character they are both textbook definition of one note and every chance at them getting any amount of development seemed to be traded for a cheep laugh everyone will remember i am groot and the why is gamora and invisible drax joke but no one actually care about the character they came from because there s nothing to care about rocket raccoon i thought wa well done actually no note gamora is cool when she isn t just being peter girlfriend james gunn seems to really like the idiot boy meet badass girl trope which i m not a fan of and gamora seems to be thoroughly stuck in the badass girl dating idiot boy role i think her arc with nebula wa good and i wish we got more of that her being killed off while implying thanos did truly love her then bringing back a version wa some of the most wtf writing i ve ever seen but go off i guess mantis hasn t had a whole lot of screen time but i feel like she s going in the same direction a drax and groot where pom s performance is so bubbly and cute that she just get used for audience pleasing joke instead of real character growth thor screenshots have shown that she ll be doing something with thor so hopefully it s more serious nebula wa cool no note yondu wa cool although not sure why they made it seem like he wa actually a good father figure in the end while spending movie telling u he wasn t but go off and finally peter quill despite being the the main guardian and the protagonist of both guardian movie star lord fall into the same trap a drax and groot half the time peter could be developing a a character he s instead being made the butt of a joke that joke being that he s stupid hence idiot boy meet badass girl trope a much a i love pre comic starlord i m not mad that his outfit weaponry and personality were changed i m just mad they made him stupid and a joke the best part about pre comic peter wa that he wa an intelligent leader who had the respect of people way stronger than him fine make him a goofy space pirate but i hate that he s an idiot who no one respect despite being the leader of the guardian for the first movie fine but that should ve changed after or even during the second movie so yeah i guess my main issue with these character is how often making a joke trump character development but these are just my opinion i d like to hear opinion on these character
richard from thor the dark world anyone else feel bad for the guy doing a thor marathon and richard basically got dumped because he wasn t thor plus he mentioned he d just been cheated on before he met jane i hope he found someone this is my second posting had the name mixed up
i thought hawkeye wa better than loki i know this is not what most people believe but i really thought that the storyline of hawkeye wa so much better than loki i loved the family oriented story both clint and kate and the action scene were fantastic i understand that the loki storyline open up the entire multiverse and i did enjoy it my personal thought is that hawkeye wa so much more better and florence pugh wa just amazing
did bane have a vitamin d deficiency you merely adopted the dark i wa born in it molded by it i didn t see the light until i wa already a man by then it wa nothing to me but blinding bane the dark knight rise one of the primary source of vitamin d is sunlight just a thought of course there are other source for vitamin d but still no sunlight
a question thats been bothering me for a while so when hulk snapped in the endgame if someone let s call him bob wa sitting on a chair got blipped he then came back but if there wa someone jeff who hadn t blipped who wa sitting on the same chair right before hulk snapped what happens to bob doe he sit on his lap or doe he go inside him similar to game like minecraft how doe that work
is hank pym and avenger technically he should be because he literally made antman and the wasp and there pretty useful also it wa his tech that allowed endgame to even happen and i mean if black widow and clint get to be avenger so doe hank pym right
this is bullcrap right http www cbr com dc best hero stupid bad name amp

potential headcanon jason wa considered the most brutal violent robin because he matched batman s brutality dick a the og robin wa obviously kicking as but wa not a brutal a batman wa at such a young age i m sure this ha been said over and over again before but it ha honestly bothered me that jason wa considered reckless and violent when he wa just following his mentor again this is not a new concept and probably ha been said before now the thing about dick being le violent may or may not be true i have not done that much research into how violent dick wa a robin there are probably panel that show they may have been the same level of brutality and the writer just really hated jason but in my mind the reason jason wa considered more reckless dangerous wa because his violence wa on par with batman and honestly he probably had the recklessness of any other kid please don t hate in the comment dick wa an amazing robin obviously a the og just wanted to offer this comparison to see what people think keep it civil though

unpopular opinion most sidekick trigger suspension of disbelief but not all of them some can bounce bullet or have the right age but most can be killed with a bullet and the police would press charge against their mentor a huge green elephant can be killed with a bullet or an arrow and if the police can barely tolerate batman the entire city would be outraged by the sight of a year old following him in bright color with no pant that being said a teenager with the kind of skill superboy wonder girl or damian have would certainly need an outlet they are natural field agent i don t mean that there shouldn t be a robin but in the case of dick jason and tim they should be training and assisting from the cave until they become legal batman the animated series handled dick very well but tim not so much keep in mind that the original reason for robin wa to have a watson well alfred became a more logical choice but thanks to online communication now underaged robin can do it from the cave a for the titan it s just the same underaged robin can command from the computer some titan are powerhouse on a jla level but roy garth gar and vic can be killed by a thug with a gun archer are at the bottom of the food chain it make sense for robin hood but now it s like trying to block the impact of a train with an umbrella green bullet make sense green arrow not so much other teenager that make sense are independent act like static or blue beetle iii or spider man they are doing it on their own and they have the chop the common reply to this is that it is fiction and yes it doesn t need to be realistic but it doe need to have verisimilitude the physic of gun are the same and the police and justice system are not easy on vigilante there why would they go easy on teenage sidekick

what avenger story do you think could be adapted pretty well into the mcu in keeping with the mcu say you get set it at any time in the movie timeline if you wish and use whichever character around that time which avenger story would work a a movie probably a good idea to pick like two and take it a a subplot perhaps entirely up to i d just too see which story you think could be cool to adapt

thought on the xbooks since hickman left i really want to read the current xmen book i ve asked how to get into this era before i know hickman left the role of overseeing it all and may be returning at some point how have all the book been since i know people have enjoyed book like xmen red but do you think the line ha held up since his departure
is it just me or most of the current marvel comic are pretty good maybe i m in a good mood lately but i feel like the comic are firing on most cylinder right now on the x men side we ve got immortal x men which is honestly fantastic and for my money much better than hickman s ongoing x men red is excellent ewing never miss and legion of x and duggan s x men are pretty good too then we have jed mackay consistently knocking it out of the park with moon knight strange and most surprisingly iron cat though that s only a surprise for those who haven t read his black cat series because the guy writes the best felicia captain america by kelly and lanzig is just starting but already feel like the best cap run since brubaker steve s voice in this is perfect and there s an almost hickman esque vibe to the complex plot what else venom is excellent when ewing is writing ewing never miss x and ram v s carnage is a real nice neo noir crime story meet cosmic horror and speaking of horror percy s ghost rider is one of the best horror comic on stand these day i dropped cates godawful thor ongoing but gronbekk s jane foster and the mighty thor is giving me the epic mythology driven thor series i wanted shame it s just a mini i feel like i m forgetting some stuff but overall i m pleased with the current selection of comic regardless of a few bad apple black panther avenger thor hulk
power scaling infinity stone with character mcu so the power stone can destroy planet by touch alone and give the wielders un fathomable power similar to the weapon of nidavellir you have to be powerful enough to wield them or they will destroy you essentially but in infinity war we learned that some character aren t completely helpless against the stone example doctor strange v stone thanos even iron man didn t immediately get demolished like you d expect and thor managed to severely injure thanos with all enough for him to snap and get the absolute fuck out of there now back to the first stone in use ronan had the power stone and even though he should have wiped the guardian out easily he wa stupid enough to actually lose but that stone seemed dangerous in that movie but next time we see it thor is tanking it s power to his forehead essentially making his forehead stronger that planetary so my question is character like hulk or thor or thanos shouldn t fear someone like ronan even if he ha the power stone correct like these being are individually more powerful than the stone that s how the mcu kind of paint it
is intergang just the mafia but armed with alien weaponry i m curious about where intergang stand in the criminal underworld of the dc universe i ve read online that they were formed in the s and became the most powerful crime cartel in metropolis but tobias whale and the with the backing of lex luthor took complete control of the metropolis drug trade forcing bruno mannheim into a truce that limited intergang to weapon trafficking anyway intergang seems to be structured like a traditional mafia family a lot of their member seem to wear classic gangster attire like old school mafioso but they also have alien armor and advanced weapon also more realistic mafia organization like the falcone crime family exist in the dc universe so basically i m wondering if intergang maybe started out a a fictionalized version of the mafia what do you all think

dcamu nightwing to preface dick grayson is my favorite dc character however i m not part of the nightwing solo he s the main character crowd he is an a lister in term of respect from other hero and experience a well a real world popularity but he can still totally get rocked by lot of people the dcamu version of dick grayson is probably the most accurate portrayal of him we ve seen over the other four main one btas teen titan young justice titan i think his arc and characterization are near perfect his quippy wisecrack his older brother vibe closeness to bruce but desire to be out of batman s shadow and his mentor relationship to damian he get his as beat too much but that s a nitpick at most he only really get one spotlight adventure in the series bad blood while bad blood isn t the best one in the series inconsistent portrayal of talia sloppy plot etc it s still solid and doe an excellent job of showing dick s relationship to not only bruce but batman a well basically he s good and i like him

it s here s what i think of the justice league cast not justice league the movie justice league the cast also this doesn t include zachary levi a shazam even though he wa incredible in shazam nor doe it include margot robbie a harley quinn even though she wa incredible in that role this is just the justice league member henry cavill a superman this one s a bummer for me because you have a giant nerd playing a giant jock henry cavill wa built to play batman but he signed on a superman and played it a batman like a possible and part of that s zach snider being emo and trying to subvert the character eventually coming up with something that is equidistant from the comic and brightburn but still superman s the kind of guy who simultaneously want to save the world and help an old lady across the street henry cavill s superman wanted to make out with lois lane and help his mom from a distance he s not personable and he life in an isolated awkward bubble with few people who can get close in conclusion i think a reboot here would do the character some good ben afflek a batman might a well be henry cavill playing both role honestly this batman is violent and stoic and ha the bonus of tossing out every possible memorable batman moment and skipping right to the end at least henry cavill s superman had the distinction of being allowed to have relationship seriously the most personable thing this iteration doe is save harley in suicide squad after he punch her in the face batman s not a loner he s the kind of weirdo that adopts an orphan because said orphan stole his hubcap and another one who tried to murder him he s got some dad energy and i don t think ben afflek or possibly the sort of middle ground script that he got allowed him to play the role of a guy who honestly want the best for the next generation gal gadot a wonder woman honest to goodness i hope gal gadot is still playing wonder woman at like year old i went back and watched some of the old lynda carter wonder woman show and it s good but i retroactively see gal gadot a the correct wonder woman choice jason mamoa a aquaman the best part of the aquaman movie wa definitely aquaman himself i like the interpretation of aquaman a the big aggressive seeming dudebro and i think jason mamoa really play it up so well my favorite part of the whole movie wa that scene at the beginning in the bar when him and these bikers look like they re sizing each other up then wind up on a wild night of drinking and laughing absolute gold jason mamoa is going to be tough to replace ezra miller a the flash ezra miller ha this kind of nervous energy that work for the role but it also work for someone who took a lot of drug and groomed child since apparently the second one seems to be true that s literally all i can see now and i think they could replace him with any given skinny guy and have an equally valid flash i don t think evan peter is doing anything right now he wa a good quicksilver why not flash ray fisher a cyborg he s stoic i don t really have a whole lot of positive or negative stuff to say about the guy he played the character he did it he said all the line and wa in the place he needed to be but if they pulled a war machine on him i wouldn t feel anything in particular about it i think if the dude get a movie he s going to need to get a writer who s very different from zach snider and joss whedon who s able to humanize an actor a lot more i think ray fisher s personality get washed out in the big action packed fight scene in a way that the other actor don t but also it s hard to find other stuff with him in it since he s a pretty new actor he might still be trying to figure himself out i don t know for sure but what i do know is that he seems a lot more robotic than i expected from a character literally called cyborg conclusion i have nothing against any of these actor except maybe ezra miller after the allegation that being said i think gal gadot and jason mamoa are the absolute keeper and the rest could theoretically be replaced we re getting a new batman who know about superman flash and cyborg but i do think jumping into a high stake movie with the strongest hero wa a bit too soon marvel jumped into the avenger with of the having gotten their own movie the other two appearing in other movie and the villain having appeared a a villain in a previous film it s not like joss whedon suddenly forgot how to make a successful superhero movie it s more that joss whedon wa given a setup for s avenger that is not hard to succeed with so yeah i think anything else justice league is too soon i think we need an upbeat non emo superman a batman who can hold down relationship but not romance a flash who act heroic and a cyborg who get excited about thing happening this ha been an opinion not an absolute fact thank you for reading this entire diatribe very generous of you

legacy character shouldn t exist this is probably a hot take but i ll explain the day bruce wayne hang it up there should never be another batman give the next hero his own identity the best example of this is nightwing dick grayson ha spent almost year becoming his own man with his own identity he doesn t need the batman name to succeed this organic character growth should happen to all the other former robin s batman is batman because of the person underneath the trauma the personality the character growth jason todd wearing the batsuit is jason todd not batman the same thing with superboy give him his own name and identity separate from clark there will never ever be another superman connor and or jon should create new identity that showcase who they are a individual and what make them hero without needing to just slap an s on their chest now when it come to green lantern this would be my only real separation because the lantern corp are set up a military organization where the name itself is more a rank than a superhero identity lantern of or lantern of etc etc etc but instead of trying to shoehorn sidekick into their mentor let them instead show why they are individual and unique by giving them their own name independent of the hero they help kind of curious what others think
how would you feel about the mcu being a musical i have wondered about how different hollywood cinema would be if they followed the style of indian cinema and made more soundtrack and musical number in classic indian cinema movie song were usually an annoyance but in the recent movie director and writer would accomodate them to contribute to the plot so it got me thinking what the mcu would be like if fight emotional scene or important plot moment had some kind of character singing or a background song to go with it it would either be pretty cool or funny i would personally prefer if there were background song but the though of the avenger singing about how awesome they are would be pretty funny i could see stark thor or quill doing that

i changed my mind so rewatching multiverse of madness ive changed my mind originally watching this movie i gave it a a i felt that it regressed wanda s character and that s the resolution seemed to just wrap up everything a it seemed everything that s happened in the movie didn t matter but rewatching for a second time i feel that now wanda vision ha escaped my head a little bit i can see how truly frightening wanda is and i could feel her grief through her performance but still i feel that i could only feel this from her because i have forgotten the journey she took in wanda vision but still good movie third strange is an absolute dick in every single universe and he really should be a better person but still america chavez could have disappeared half way into the movie and i wouldn t have noticed which isn t good when you are trying to build up a potential young avenger team the horror element were very good i always believed that but i felt they could have just run wild with wanda she could if she wanted to destroy universe so why not use it all in all i give the movie an but let me hear your guy thought on the second watch through

what if tyler durden is bruce banner f c now this theory is one that is going to blow you re mind now spoiler if you haven t seen fc tyler durden or at least thats what he think his name is is a man troubling from multiple personality disorder in the movie it is seen that he adapts a new look for himself a brad pitt onto the next topic edward norton play hulk in he also play the what we are going to call the author in fc the author once tried to kill himself with a bullet which killed tyler durden bruce banner tried to do the same which lead me to my next question what if the author adapted the personality of bruce banner after shooting himself and lived out the rest of his life practicing science which he already knew a bit about it s entirely possible that the actor change from edward norton to mark ruffalo in the mcu wa also a reference to the fact that the author can perceive himself in any physical image that s pretty much the bottom of the theory lemme know if this is plausible
if you could have any character s power hero or villain who s would you choose this is a really hard question but i would go for comic echo or comic taskmaster only if you don t get his memory loss because learning how to do anything by just seeing someone do it unless they have superpower and you don t would be so useful like i could just watch anyone do anything and learn how to do it even if it took them year of practice

can someone explain the power of the green lantern ring so i looked at the wiki for the green lantern ring dc database but i still have question concerning the actual ability of the ring many of these question sprung from the feat of hal jordan like the dude made his own ring and it made him immortal so the wiki listed the power of the green lantern ring a so energy projection beam pew pew force field not construct but the green outline shown on the user s body energy construct creation superhuman strength phasing environmental playback time travel wtf there s no actual way right energy twin flight and life support wormhole and spatial warp so if they can teleport wtf don t they do it more often in show and comic resurrection i remember hal used this after he purposely killed himself just to show that he could bi pas the ring s wont let you kill yourself defense via his will just to prove a point so is he immortal and preset condition so i could order the ring to kill the next user after i die so basically i wa wondering if someone could clarify the mess above into something coherent before back in my ignorance i thought the power ring only provided hard light construct powered by will and life support ah to be young and ignorant

did anyone else stop reading dc comic since the infinite frontier status quo i know probably a lot of them are good but the concept of dc s continuity is so convoluted right now that i m overly confused by our omni verse that after reading a few comic i gave up to understood what wa currently canon which is funny considering that the point of all this is to make everything canon i preferred when dc divided itself by era because if you wanted to read a random comic you could kinda understand everything by the era it wa suited that may be pre crisis post crisis new or whatever now day i mostly read old comic and won t probably go back to new one until thing are more organized

so why do yellow lantern ring choose their user like that other ring choose their user based on how strongly they feel and can channel the attributed emotion hal ha a lot of will so he get a green lard lee is greedy a hell so he get the orange atrocitus is a angry a someone can get so he get a red etc but yellow are chosen for their ability to instil fear in others not because they feel immense fear themselves i jus find it odd since if the user is not producing the emotion then what is powering and channeling the ring to make it construct if the ring pulled from the fear of those around it then it would never be able to be proactive and unable to create fear since fear is first required to use the ring i get that it would be hard to have a villainous faction that can barely fight due to being too terrified of everything but i still think it would work to have the user be very fearful people i will clarify i m not the biggest reader of the lantern comic i read the modern stuff but my old lore is very lacking

thought on venom what are your thought on this movie it s definitely no masterpiece by any mean not even close hardy doe well with what he ha to work with ha fun with it all i mean the man is entertaining no matter what c mon he made eddie his own and did very well with venom himself venom is really a badass character in this movie and definitely the next one thankfully he wa a lot more realized in the sequel given a lot more screen time and more to do with this movie and let there be carnage they really should have called it rise of carnage or something that title is so wordy venom is a lot closer to past version of him i ve seen in past stuff like game and the s cartoon hell if anything he s closest to the version of venom in the p spider man game and it work very well he s got this over the top personality ha fun in the thing he doe say we his goofy a lot and is intimidating when he want to be a for complaint about this movie the writing definitely needed a lot better writing a lot of thing did not make sense riot going across the world for a long a he did inside of this very elderly woman on foot the whole time when before her he wa inside this very fresh young woman also the dialogue wow the majority of it wa absolutely terrible and it wa delivered so idek how to describe it i mean most of the dialogue between eddie and venom wa passable to good but other than that yikes and the fight between venom and riot wa really fucking bad shit lighting and overall visuals sludge like fighting between to dark colored cgi symbiotes this movie is very messy but decent for what it is hardy definitely make it watchable and venom is very nice to watch and that swat scene wa easily one of the best part in my possibly very unpopular opinion let there be carnage doe vastly improve on the many problem i have with this movie and holy shit wa that big fight near the end badass compared to venom v riot
to who ever really loved the multiverse of madness cool for you but you can read this if you want this is my opinion so get triggered but the movie isn t good it ha a not that great storyline the illuminati died in like minute the girl took till the end to figure out that all she needed to do wa put ch the air to go to a new reality and the movie wa just in general about killing a child for two child who wanda ended up getting forever petrified by her and the story wa kinda fast paced but also while not telling okay so here the illuminati and here the people cool but if you are going to tell that dont kill them in or minute of them getting introduced so tldr the movie wa about killing a kid for two child who in the end got really scared of wanda and the kid took till the end to find out that she needed to punch the air to travel to a different reality
so did multiverse of madness have no climax to be honest it wa kind of a let down

am i the only one who think the death of almost all the illuminaty member didnt make sense allow me to elaborate first we have black bolt he went for his sonic boom thing or whatever it is and wanda closed his mouth with skin so you re telling me his sonic boom could destroy two layer of his skull which is the strongest bone in human body and his brain but not pas through a simple thin layer of skin next wa mr fantastic you need more effort to kill mr fantastic man also a real mr fantastic would be able to survive this but somwthing that really annoys me is not his death it his attack what wa he supposed to do with his hand close wandas mouth next is captain carter cool fight cold and reasonable death ohohoho captain marvel she died by a couple of rock thrown at her shes fkng captain marvel shes durable she is supposed to be able to take worse thing thatn just rock and finally professor x which i think this is his third or fourth death on the big screen lol poor guy yeah anyways he try to get in wandas mind blah blah blah boom red fog boom ugly as wanda rip his head in half all that in other wandas mind how tf did he die in the real world he just died there wa no fucking cause of his death

venom this movie is not good hardly at all some cool moment but overall the movie is pretty horrible it seems to me like hardy know this but is like fuck it i m just gonna have fun with this i ll do better in the next movie he doe give a really hammy performance but make this movie watchable venom himself is well done in this movie a far a the design his dialogue and personality and the action stuff but there is no fleshing out his relationship with eddie at all in one scene they are not totally getting along but two scene later they are totally cool the dialogue overall in this horrible i mean it seems like the script barely got two draft in before they starting filming i mean the writing is just cringey af and hardly feel like how people actually talk and the delivery of all this dialogue bad man carlton drake also suck a a villain he is not scary at all i mean it s the crap writing and riz ahmed is the least intimidating actor they could have possibly found plus he is experimenting on homeless people that alone doe not make sense i mean homeless ppl are not exactly the healthiest and nourished people on the planet my point is these ppl are malnourished and he keep wondering why the subject keep failing but whatever riot is hardly any better a villain for starter he ha hardly any screen time and his goal is to take over the planet but get fried eh i m really not seeing the praise with this movie at all

what is drax really like plain dumb or someone cultivated i m asking this because i m playing the guardian of the galaxy game and you can see he s a very cultivated person apart from thing like he reading a book between chapter the only lack of intelligence i see in him is social for example he say the full name when referring to quill and can t catch sarcasm or irony but apart from that he isn t dumb or anything like that but in the movie doesn t feel is the same drax he feel like the typical bit dumb character that say a funny line and that s it take my perception with a grain of salt since it been year from the last time i saw the movie so how really is drax someone who is cultivated or some muscle with little brain
is batman considered a domestic terrorist he owns weapon of war in the guise of fighting crime although he doe go after some bad people isn t this breaking the law and is vigilante justice legal also considering hal jordan is a police officer and work with him is he considered a someone who is breaking the law on top of that his action in many case result in massive amount of property damage and civil unrest so wouldn t that also be on his shoulder

remaking vision dont read if you have finished wandavision or dr strange madness of the multiverse couldn t wanda actually have vision back in wandavision in the last episode we see the white vision made from hayward reusing wanda s material i think i wa confused on this so don t quote me anyway what if wanda took matter from westview and reshaped it to make vision she doesn t need to recreate his mind because she ha enough memory of him to make him his own person she can control people it would be nothing for her to take the memory she ha and make it into a chip to insert into his brain even without an infinity stone he literally had a separate personality and everything when he realized the truth she just need enough vibranium which she could easily get manipulating matter to mimic it i know monica s clothes were made of kevlar and so when they converted they still were made of it well either she take precious metal to remake his body or she go back to the lab where his body is and remake it adding a few material i mean come on it make no sense that she d suffer so much following the rule in wandavision only to break rule and get nothing in madness of the multiverse

what fan get wrong about the justice league and legacy hero i ve seen a number of fan on here who want to see the justice league line up changed in a more permanent fashion especially with retiring the old hero and having them succeeded by legacy character or alternatively some fan perhaps don t feel the need to have younger hero succeed to any mantle but instead just want character like the titan to helm the league a their own identity dark crisis is definitely exploring these idea in some interesting way even if it s clear the status quo will reset after the event is over in my opinion however this mentality reflects a fundamental misunderstanding what truly make the justice league the justice league isn t the name it s the magnificent seven and especially the trinity any version of the jl that doesn t include clark kent bruce wayne and diana prince will always be lesser in addition to being around for year the trinity are alongside spider man the most iconic beloved and celebrated superheroes across the entire world

are there any marvel comic light novel a one would find in manga ip so i ve recently gotten into actually purchasing and reading comic i ve bought a couple of collection book which are soo cool but it got me thinking coming to comic after year of anime after watching which i made a collection out of buying the volume of whatever my favorite series were why don t marvel or dc for that matter make light novel or are they just rarity i can t spot at my local book store
moonknight wa underwhelming not exaggerating and i can honestly say that i actually prefer the m marvel show it s more fun and lively plus the essence of family feel very nice and welcoming haven t felt or seen that in a long time however with moonknight for me it felt like a superhero version of living with yourself it wa just hard for me to like a show with only like character and the rest being god totally not relatable plus the friendship between marc and steven felt very rushed one episode marc punch steve and then two episode later he is already hugging him and they become best friend nah i d rather watch thor and homecoming which are my least favorite mcu film who else felt the show wa overhyped i ll say two great thing about it though the transformation into mr knight is beautiful and clean and secondly all of the konshu scene i personally would give it it a and m marvel a wandavision is still my favorite show in the mcu at a

what version of the teen titan do you think would work best for a cinematic adaptation in a hypothetical rebooted dceu for me i think a combination of the new teen titan and the teen titan would be the best choice for the big screen why well the new teen titan are by far the most iconic and popular version of the team period a big reason for this being that it introduced unique story and character that helped the team differentiate itself from the justice league e g trigon juda contract etcetera thereby giving them an identity of their own instead of just having them be watered down version of their mentor but why do i say that the teen titan run should be combined with this well for one because i personally think superboy should also be on the team considering how iconic he is a well a how great his origin story is what with being tied to the death of superman and all that however the main reason i think the teen titan should be combined with the new teen titan is because i think cassie sandsmark is a more interesting wonder girl who can also serve a greater purpose in helping along other hypothetical plotlines within the dceu for example you could have such that after robin becomes nightwing he decides to leave the team in order to be with and work alongside oracle after she wa crippled with cassie taking leadership of the team in his stead something she ha proven capable of doing a seen when she took charge of the team after winning the vote against robin furthermore cassie also ha a much more straightforward continuity and backstory then donna troy doe thus there would be le convolution there basically my take on it is that i think that the new teen titan is the best version of the team and most obvious choice to get a cinematic adaptation just with the minor edit of adding superboy and replacing donna troy with cassie sandsmark in any case what do you think what version of the teen titan do you believe would work best for the big screen and why

who decides which change get made to the comic to be more in line with the mcu i noticed something s don t get changed for example makkari is now a female and so are sprite and ajak from the eternals i don t know if agatha ha appeared in the comic since wandavision but afaik she s still a much older woman and also ghost i know some thing make more sense to leave unchanged like comic aunt may can t just be a young a she is in the mcu
who is earth s hero one thing i ve noticed is that in the mcu iron man is essentially seen a the world s hero probably due to rdj s great portrayal and the popularity of the character skyrocketing what i m curious about is since i can t find anything saying that it s the same in comic who would be considered the marvel earth s hero i ve heard spider man is considered to be the by other hero but most people consider him new york hero first and foremost and that while he ha been in big situation that affect the whole world he wouldn t be considered in that aspect i feel that i should clarify this is about the consensus among the general population of the marvel world i m not asking who is the strongest or who the real actually is or who should be though i m curious to hear what you have on those subject so feel free to mention them it s just not the focus but about who the citizen hope for when there s danger basically who is marvel superman
ok but i like the incredible hulk sure the love story element is kinda lame but it also ha a lot of fun little moment that most other marvel movie don t bother with like when betty go shopping to buy bruce stretchy pant or later on when she asks him what it s like to be the monster then there s the part where they take the speeding taxi straight out of ghostbusters and betty get angrier than bruce idk i just think more movie could use little character moment like that the kind that you usually see in fanfiction but never on screen because movie don t have time for that now

unpopular opinion current x men series i just can t get into xmen since house of x another unpopular opinion could be the reason for this is that i could never get into hickman s work i m curious if i m one of a few or if more felt the same a the majority do praise it and love hickman s work ironically i feel much like our fave mutant and an outcast when it come to x book now the whole dying and reincarnation is one thing that bother me more so when we ve had past x story dealing with the after life make it feel to me that the reincarnation are more lile clone and my fave mutant are probably dead i m more bothered hickman s left it something that i wa always content with the series despite my not enjoying it wa hickman once stated in an interview that he like to write this like taking all the toy out the toybox but putting them back after he s played with them so they are back to how they were left when he found them so i had the impression it wasn t permanent and we d eventually down the line find ourselves back in westchester with xavier school and some mutant going back to their villain route

i find it very difficult to get into comic okay so i have two major issue i really like somewhat old story if you ve ever played ultimate alliance that is the era of comic book story however i cannot stand the writing of those old comic book where there wa a yellow background panel with the main character doing a flip and about three essay worth of text where said character is thinking about their own power not that i dislike reading but i think modern comic do it right with their combination of visuals and dialogue is there a modern version retelling of old story and arc i can t for the life of me find what i m supposed to be reading after an issue and dislike that a lot of thing are happening that i don t know about say i m reading the amazing spider man number or whatever well when you get to character talk about event that happened in amazing spider man even more amazing that i didn t know about and now i have to look for it it s even worse when they do it a a series but split into two comic and for this one i have a real example with real issue number if you read amazing spider man it end saying you now have to read peter parker spider man which btw i also haven t found in marvel unlimited because the one of the time period is named differently and doesn t align with what i m reading in issue and the one with the correct name is from another time period completely the story then continues in and then in which i also haven t found how are you supposed to keep up with this why not make it a single issue why are there different issue of spider man all with just number how can i know when to read them chronologically anyway thanks for reading my rant and hopefully someone can help me find someway to organize my reading surely there are chronological list and modern retellings but i haven t found them if it help what i m mostly looking for is spider man daredevil and x men

i ve seen eternals and i m reading the comic some thought i m issue into the issue run of jack kirby s eternals to compare it to the movie is interesting because what the filmmaker did wa pretty much they kept all the essential thematic concept and origin story aspect in term of their purpose and being created by the celestials but they streamlined it a best they could and they did a modern reinvention like an ultimate comic type of updating which is fine because if you were to make a race of super being to help evolve humanity youd want them to look like all of humanity the only change i don t like but i understand the artistic reasoning behind it is they changed the deviant the movie is just a modern retelling of that material

wanda s state of mind psyche in multiverse of madness possible spoiler amp x b http i redd it jfk avrlqb gif hey all before reading further this depicts information about wanda in mom if you have not seen the film or have not watched wandavision do not proceed further unless you do not mind spoiler or have seen the series i wanted to share some thought in this community a i have re watched multiverse of madness just a few time since it release both in theater and a few time with a couple of different friend group who have caught up on the newer marvel storyline i have been following the storyline for some time i used to be into the comic when i wa younger but did not follow every plot line i mostly have read summary and brief note on basically what happens chronologically across the comic series in comparison to the movie wanda s progression through mcu cinema universe she is introduced a a mutant initially who gained her power from the mind stone then we see her involvement in hyrda leading her pietro to temporarily band with ultron against tony stark for vengeance a stark technology wa responsible for the military technology equipment used that inadvertently during a strike bombed and killed maximoff s parent we see her introduction in age of ultron and the introduction of vision her becoming alliance with the avenger when pietro dy and she realizes ultron s true plan for destruction i think it s really important to consider that wanda had lost everything prior to this time in her life from her parent to pietro to then losing the avenger this brings me to a later point but natalya steve rogers helped to train her and tried to help her control her power which of course brought about the unfortunate situation in the civil war where her power accidentally caused the death and explosion of a building while using her telekinesis to evade a bomber from harming people at ground level during a battle that steve encountered during the beginning of the film wanda go through a lot of trauma from being orphaned experimented on seen a a monster publicly due to her power and then forced into hiding after the conflict from civil war amp x b wanda v thanos what if it wa very interesting to me that wanda became undead in the what if spin off and they displayed different perspective briefly of the scarlet witch from an undead type variant perspective who wa still very powerful against the avenger a an enemy this got me thinking though before even seeing multiverse of madness but after seeing end game wanda displayed a huge amount of power and threat against thanos which became a noticeable feat amongst fan kevin feige confirmed her power amongst finally displaying some level of comic scarlet witch power doctor strange saw countless different reality in which they only defeated thanos according to him but what if this wa not just the case and strange overlooked reality in which there were alternative point in time or blind spot overlooked in his vision where wanda the scarlet witch would be able to defeat him i do want to caveat and say of course for writing movie purpose the torch wa passed to tony stark iron man who ended up carrying it out this decision from strange to hand thanos the time stone did the following sequence of event wanda killed vision in order to protect thanos from getting thanos revers time killing vision meant nothing according to wanda in multiverse of madness and kill vision to steal the mind stone thanos kill half of the universe with a snap including herself who disappear for many year tony stark revers time but in doing so natalya dy while sacrificing herself for a stone captain america decides to join an alternative timeline after being introduced to the multiversal concept of time age in the present day and tony stark pass leading to the end of the avenger wanda end up losing her friend her love and her safety due to this timeline alternative timeline example wanda face thanos earlier in infinity war possibly us her power to get the gauntlet off of him or subdue him sooner wanda and vision try to face thanos in wakanda and or wanda release her power from wandavision sooner either from killing vision or out of fear of vision dying protecting vision that she unlocks her power to shape reality is able to use this to counteract his stone and subdue him to where thor show up and kill him wandavision event there s a lot of ongoing discussion and debate still on the action of wanda here i have written past post but i will summarize that she is a grey character this match her character arc this storyline felt like a remix of the house of m storyline will not spoil that but a take on wanda losing her mind and her descent into becoming the scarlet witch i found the series very intriguing nostalgic very much a toy on the psyche and make you wonder the length you would go to if you knew you had the power to alter reality clearly here though we see the mental instability of wanda slowly slip and she becomes aggressive toward vision even her kid at some point in her neglect of being honest with them about the legitimate chaos ensued around them from her power and how she brainwashes the townspeople i do empathize with her a we do see she doe not realize her power at first but then doe catch on that it is intentional and she begin to bend the dark magic to her whim while trying to maintain self preservation of her own interest in keeping vision and her child agatha is also a grey character who we learn wa not all bad though she did introduce wanda to the darkhold grave mistake but very strange and i feel will come full circle a we need question answered there a to why agatha had it in the first place and why if wanda wa so dangerous she would introduce her to the darkhold overall i loved wandavision and the slow descent into madness for wanda after year of build up from the marvel film and it showed how well developed wanda s character ha become wanda wa the villain of her own story and while she made it right in the end this wa only because she wa forced to once vision became suspicious the outside world wa catching on and agatha confronted her a a fellow witch a very key observation here is similar to shang chi s father a well for those who have seen the movie where his dad became corrupted by the ring and began to hear the voice of his wife calling for his help at the end of wandavision we see wanda with the darkhold and she hears her child calling for help i wonder if this will tie in with each other at some point but it did foreshadow the corruption we then see in multiverse of madness amp x b multiverse of madness the scarlet witch i actually very much enjoyed the take on wanda s now full descent into becoming a villain it wa not the best marvel movie in my opinion but it very much felt like an age of ultron type in between exposition film to help character develop a built and fill in some new plot introduction about concept for our main character also similar to civil war in the sense that strange and wanda are having a very personal conflict i understand in this case where wanda is wrong she ha clearly become corrupted by the darkhold and ha knowingly abused her chaos magic after knowing the event of wandavision she still took the darkhold from agatha and manipulated dark magic to try and take america s power and overall ha become ruthless in her pursuit to enslave chavez for her power so she can essentially rule being able to become a witch of multiversal travel both to claim her son and conquer any challenge through traveling the multiverse for endless solution to problem i know people felt upset or either did not see wandavision or have not watched all past marvel film or know of her comic book character arc know this wa not a random descent to madness or villainous for wanda s character i also appreciated the realism in her disdain for strange a i believe she learned a few thing which the fan then end up becoming aware of or i think can become more aware of to consider maybe strange s way to win the war against thanos wa not the only way to defeat him meaning other reality possible where vision life wanda preserve her life with the avenger strange never considered the book of vishanti he even called it a hoax and myth at certain point where it end up being revealed a true this could have been a deciding factor possibly in defeating thanos from both timeline strange end up becoming corrupt in multiple reality which wanda learns and is likely why she call him a hypocrite we learn he dream walk causing an incursion dangles him with an opportunity to be with christine for eternity a a trick to lure his desire for love power always holding the knife amongst other issue revealed that he essentially break multiversal concept i am sure the event of no way home infinity war end game all combined to this moment have not helped the scarlet witch ha learned that her power may have been enough to defeat thanos her disdain for strange based solely on this is evident you notice during the final scene of end game a wanda is both grieving you notice that the two magical being never interact once looking back to this moment i wonder how upset wanda may have actually been with strange s decision to sacrifice them all including himself and be the master of fate essentially which brought them to this moment where wanda ha lost everyone forever strange continuously tell her the kid aren t real this show how much more developed she is in her knowledge of the multiverse and magic in area he is not strong in but proceeds to claim he know it all i e always holding the knife i understand where this anger her more a she find him condescending and hypocritical based on his event from no way home and also in his pursuit to determine the fate of the infinity war end game war at the whim of his this is the only way decision wanda probably doe not trust his judgment this coupled with her corruption and the darkhold similar to shang chi s father calling for help and to be saved from demon is likely why wanda snap the magical corruption the thirst to get her child back the battle against those who mock her magical child who actually do exist and she probably really is mentally convinced that the greater good for the multiverse is to steal chavez s power the moment we realize wanda basically is considered a supernatural god like being where chthon had created wundagore the darkhold gifted her basically with chaos magic she and the audience realize more that she had the potential to stop thanos in our universe a did other universe using other mean of magic such a the book of vishanti which strange kept dreamwalking anyways in hope to find a solution to defeating thanos and though he never did continued to use corrupt magic the parallel between wanda and strange in the film i think are very well done and in fact show that no decision made may have been finite in the scope of the multiverse in term of having way to kill thanos and it also show the possibility within both strange a a grey character who may be a dangerous or similar to wanda the scarlet witch the ending of the movie without delving too much into it i will not say what i think the fate is of wanda but i do think her variant will have consequence play out from needing to prove her innocence in that universe due to the destruction caused by the scarlet witch i also do think house of harkness will cover the aftermath of multiverse of madness while looking into agatha s past a well and i do feel a if wanda s death wa actually a spell or some type of self preserving prison to keep herself captive this reminds me of a spin on something they did similar in the comic where wanda exile herself temporarily due to an event that happened this is why to me this is similar to age of ultron and civil war where it s introducing a larger foe possible kang nightmare etc and now that wanda is dead there is a possibility she can be controlled or taken advantage of also just want to say loved the whole vibe of the movie i give it a solid it wa like a b for me in term of marvel i loved the visuals the music wa great and the dream walking explanation scene from mordo is one of my favorite marvel scene i think now of all time overall a very fun movie
how is the dc universe infinite app because since amazon integrated comixology to their system like the app is really mediocre for me amp even on the web their layout is not good
the joker is just normal person in the comic joker is known to be super sane and joker know he is not in a real place too joker is like a player in a sandbox game like gta where you murder to just murder if a normal person knew they were in a comic they wouldn t act normal they would act careless joker killing is just like a player punching a npc
do you think the comic will ever get a definitive ending at least a far a is concerned do you think it ll end i mean it must at some point no i can t imagine people will be reading about spider man and mj splitting up for the billionth time century from now
something i ve been wanting to say this is going to be harsh so many people right now are not happy with the phase movie because they grew up with phase they dont make movie like they did before like phase movie aren t even that bad they re decently enjoyable it s so annoying to hear everyone complain how marvel ha lost it s charm comparing current movie with iron man and shit the only reason you got obsessed with iron man or any other early phase movie is because that shit wa new to you seeing a superhero that can fly ha power and save the world with cgi near perfection for the first time is what sold it all we have lost the character that we grew up with that doesn t mean we need to turn into damn critic and compare every new movie to the glory of marvel s past movie glory in quote because it wa only glorious because it wa new y all want marvel to sell new stuff experiment and take risk but also at the same time don t fail to compare the new one with the old one and turn sour like grandpa s i agree movie can be good bad but this hard criticism like your life depends on it for thor l amp t m marvel mom she hulk for god s sake that series isn t even out yet every time a new movie come out y all are ready to look for and point out all the flaw stop putting those movie on pedestal y all sound like bitter old people that s all

what are some way you think dc can make a comeback my suggestion and opinion you can disagree or add on no hate better use of their animation team kingdom come injustice more recent dark knight of steel all of these limited series could be made into multiple season tv show or movie dc ha tie with studio mir studio behind you g justice and the legend of korra and olm behind pok mon utilizing them properly could lead to bigger revenue imagine a season injustice animated venture animated with fight choreography on par with the legend of korra or even by mappa that would be amazing especially with the popularity of evil superman i also don t like this trope however think with your wallet that s what s popular right now much more cohesive and permanent storytelling the reason why manga is at the top is because of the writing and investment when i invest time into one punch man for example i get my payoff once a decision ha been made it s over it s done no take back one thing about comic book is nothing matter joker war i wa expecting something more i thought they were gonna keep the joker out permanently nope he got away cinematic universe dc movie post josstice league have been really good in general peacemaker is better than most of the mcu show but they jumped the gun in their execution water hamada is good but taking full advantage of hbo max would be perfect the way the movie are spaced perfect they just need to keep up their quality aspect of their movie this would be perfect better digital availability comixology suck to the point in just forego buying comic book in general marvel ha the marvel app and i have to go all the way to sauga to buy comic here in ontario and they didn t even have the latest issue put the spotlight on your c d list character i love batman but give other character the spotlight aquaman is the highest grossing dc movie not the batman not man of steel not joker aquaman do more im hyped for black adam cu i know it s gonna be good what else add on judge opinion

avenger forever or avenger kang dynasty which is better i m doing this thing where i m buying just one tpb from each of my favourite marvel character team so far i ve got house of x power of x spider man life story blue kraven s last hunt etc seem to be oop daredevil born again amp fantastic four behold galactus trying to figure out what book to buy for representing the avenger on my shelf problem is most of their best stuff are entire run amp i don t want to buy multiple omnibus from hickman bendis etc so for this purpose and considering that i m not a huge fan of the dated artwork amp dialogue from kree skrull war korvac saga etc i ve narrowed my option down to avenger forever or avenger kang dynasty the issue with the former is that i ve heard that it requires a lot of prior knowledge with respect to the avenger and with the latter is that it s the ending part of busiek s avenger run so i m not sure how well it stand alone so to those who ve read both which one should i get or is there an even better option like civil war maybe

question about wolverine logan hi so i saw a tweet joking about how logan doesn t have that many kid a a result of consensual sex it got me thinking ha there ever been a comic exploring that aspect of logan in the sense of whenever a new x weapon is introduced inspired by him it s a weapon and how damaging that must be to his self image at time an example although it s probably outdated at this point cause i m not too up to date with logan is while i think it s cool wolverine laura ha such a strong kinship with her dad it must be weird at some point to remember that a lot of her trauma came from the only quality people seem to want logan for being good at killing

judgment day eternals v avenger v x men v inhumans i have a theory marvel want to reintroduce the inhumans in the mcu so in the comic marvel ha put a spotlight on black bolt in mom putting him alongside mr fantastic xavier captain marvel and captain carter all character that have cap marvel and carter or will have mr fantastic xavier relevance in film series or comic book run moreover celestials are introduced seriously in the eternals film so just remember that inhumans origin are connected to celestials giving krees the opportunity to create the inhuman race what if this wa just the right occasion to put a bigger comic spotlight on them giving people the opportunity to restart reading them preparing the public for the new series film about them similar stuff happened with other hero like black panther in while cap america civil war wa releasing film featuring the black panther for the first time in the mcu then we have lore based reason both x men x men v inhumans and eternals thanks to celestials are connected with the inhumans and avenger are playing the part of the neutral team since the beginning of the event meaning that there wouldn t be suspence on the common villain if they avenger were it that usually this kind of event feature and obv it would be too cool to see the inhumans back in action knowing how much potential they have read black bolt and most of the time in my opinion wa wasted what do you think

very late to the party but just finished nwh and wanted to share my thought i did manage to avoid most spoiler up until now aside from andrew and tobey so idk how others feel about it overall the movie wa meh i looked up rating after and wa pretty surprised to see how high they were a far a cinema go it wasn t bad but the story is what ruined it for me they pushed the good guy narrative way too far and it wa beyond reason peter ha done questionable thing on an impulse in the past to try to be good and i get that it s part of his character but putting the entire multiverse at risk to save a handful of bad guy knowing that even if you succeed there are infinite universe out there where they are still bad because may said so i just can t wrap my head around how doing that would be worth it no matter how much of a good guy you are this also ruined may s character for me the fact that before she dy she still say trying to help them wa the right thing is just b some other part of the story were also very questionable first wong he showed up in the beginning said keep me out of this and that s it you would think the actual sorcerer supreme would know or care a little more about the multiverse breaking and then there s mj went from a logical but skeptical person to immediately fully trusting peter and not even questioning any of his action especially the scene where she and ned are watching the news after may dy and they re sitting there still wondering if they should push the button i know it s all part of the story and it s what need to happen but it s such a reach in term of how the character and normal people would react also the scene where peter trap strange using math wa extremely cringe yeah they re trying to show peter combining his power with his other skill but still that wa just bad the last half of the movie i m going to be honest i had to pause and have quite a few drink before finishing the writing wa a little clunky but i think it fit kind of well with all spider man the final fight wa pretty boring and just a you d expect a typical hero team up where they struggle at some point but get it together in the end however i did really enjoy watching peter tom beat the crap out of norman it wa such a powerful moment and one of the scene that actually felt genuine and not just there to move the story along overall i would ve liked the movie much more had they not pushed the good guy narrative so hard and i m going to be bold and say that the only reason this movie is rated a well a it is is because of the actor i mean even i had my giddy moment seeing all the villain and spider come in
what s a character premise that you d really like to see a series for are there any dc character that deserve a solo series but don t have one or haven t had one in over a decade is there a character combo that you think would work great for a team up series or a pre existing superhero team that wa never revisited but ha unused potential or maybe an elseworlds concept that seems too cool to not exist share your wishful thinking here
i have a theory on why in multiverse of madness spoiler didn t go to this specific universe type ok so this is regarding why wanda never went to a universe where wanda wa dead to be with her kid argument so i believe this is because her kid couldn t live without her existence now the kid came into life through actual magic chaos magic specifically and we ve seen that when wanda s hex wa going away that her kid were going away given the amount of power probably needed to create them into living being i can imagine that it take a heavy toll on wanda s capability this could explain why wanda couldn t find a universe with her kid without wanda the amount of magic that s probably constantly required could be too much without wanda
thor spoiler a slight change to the ending of love amp thunder so i didn t love the movie but it had it merit the ending i thought wa going really well once he entered eternity but i really thought that instead of him wishing his daughter back he should have wished for a mortal afterlife the whole movie they made multiple reference to afterlives for god and even the god that gor killed specifically mocked him for there not being an afterlife which seemed to be a real trigger for him back then this would play into helping thor a it would allow jane to pas on i still don t think she should be in val halla and not force gore s daughter to live with a strange man and be a demigod mercenary when she clearly ha been through a lot including starving to death

controversial opinion focusing on the same character is making the marvel universe boring the marvel universe is big very big yet just like star war and the skywalker family almost all of the comic book that have been released in the universe focus on the same character iron man spider man blade etc this cause the issue to feel like there just repeat of the same event that happened five year ago spider man and mj argue for the th time iron man must save the day without his armour for the th time wolverine star in his millionth issue etc there is enough possible content at the moment to write about for decade without touching the usual character if every issue ha around page and each individual page featured one krakoa mutant assuming there s of them then that s issue when we get to the arakko mutant thing get much more interesting million new mutant with exciting unseen power get u up to issue a decent writer could make a fantastic issue comic for any of these character meaning that there is a possibility of at least x comic book worth of content for just mutant alone that s not even considering all the super powered individual who aren t mutant and that s just one planet instead of yet another wolverine origin story tell me a story of a civilian mutant trying to start a new life on arakko or a teenager discovering their new superpower in a city that isn t new york like rio de janeiro london or lagos hell i ll even take a issue event around paste pot pete i guess what i m trying to say is marvel ha an enormous universe to use but their biggest problem is that they rarely tap into the original and creative side of their writer

anyone else see parallel between grant morrison s run on batman and the myth of sisyphus by albert camus both are unique take on an exceedingly classic character both have the hero tragically facing the absurdity and futility of life and overcoming it with personal meaning and rebellion and both require the reader to imagine the hero happy
so damian is clearly being forced out a robin to make room for tim what are your thought on that and what do you his new mantle will be like the latest issue of robin establishes that he ll now be living in lazarus island his upcoming mini series by mark waid will have him possessed by the demon nezha which apparently the devil that the al ghul family ha been worshipping there s been hint on making damian a magic user and with all this plus dc and waid pushing their take on journey to the west recently it make me think dc is going lean on damian s chinese heritage when giving him a new mantle they might even straight up make him nezha on the tim side of thing i don t think this is the right direction to take the character it feel like he failed to move on from being a sidekick and then fall back on being a permanent sidekick

if green lantern corp is a buddy cop movie which green lantern would you want to star in it in case anyone s not familiar here s the definition of a buddy cop movie http en wikipedia org wiki buddy cop i realize that the dc cinematic universe s future is somewhat in doubt what with the flash movie possibly rebooting it and the green lantern corp movie not having much in the way of update since it announcement seven or eight year ago but i ve been reading geoff john run on green lantern and it got me wondering who people would want to see in a movie there s seven or eight green lantern from earth alone depending on if you count alan scott since he occupies a different corner of the dc universe assuming that the lantern from earth would be the focus and i figure you could probably mix and match any two of them and come up with an entertaining team where both of them use the ring s power in different way however i m not super familiar with the green lantern mythos i only really know about hal jordan and even that s mostly by reputation and john stewart and that s mainly through the justice league cartoon so i d be interested to see who people would want if the movie introduced two green lantern into this universe one might be introduced a an established veteran of the corp who we just haven t seen before though i could see there being interesting scenario with two newcomer reacting differently to everything around them

what are your thought on venom i think this film is decent heavily flawed but hell still pretty watchable for what it is venom himself is done pretty damn well design power and personality the only thing really missing is no connection to spider man at all but it doesn t hurt too much hardy certainly make eddie is own and venom too wouldn t have chosen any other actor actually i really wish that most of the dialogue got some more rewrite and that final fight definitely wa very poorly done and wa very ugly at least let there be carnage wa a massive improvement on that nonetheless it is entertaining for what it is and venom himself wa really cool

noob comic book question i don t know a lot about comic so this question always puzzled me so if dc ha a lot of writer for their main continuity what give one writer the power authority to make something canon how did someone sorry don t know the writer manage to make other comic book writer agree that aquaman would be without an arm for awhile how wa it in collective agreement that jon kent would be aged up and on the opposite end what s stopping a writer from killing off a major character like let s say blue beetle or making it canon that wonder woman loses an eye sorry if this is a silly question i know next to nothing about how comic work and i m trying to get into them more
multiverse of madness gt gt gt love and thunder just watched love and thunder and i m speechless is this the same studio that gave u gem like ragnarok civil war infinity war black panther etc there wa a lot of criticism regarding multiverse of madness mom but that movie at least tried to deliver something whereas this one is slogging in all aspect mom did have a few major drawback but overall it s a visual treat and on first viewing it feel quite well made except for the ending and part of second half maybe only on critically analysing do we really understand the wrong aspect of the movie thor on the other hand is a certified disaster jane foster though she delivers an above average performance who wa absent from the mcu for the last year not counting the s scene in endgame is suddenly brought back to the franchise which i felt is quite needle jane unlike pepper and peggy never felt quite at ease with thor in the first two installment and that wa the reason she wa axed from ragnarok and just look how it turned out instead of bringing her back mcu could have done well to focus on fan favorite valkyrie played by tessa thompson who is reduced to a mere prop in this movie the only good thing in this movie is gorr who get just scene to prove his prowess thankfully christane bale nail that even in the limited time overall his movie may be like the batman and robin of mcu that may be an overstatement but seeing your favorite hero being reduced to such a mess really give you a shitty feeling

what were your annoyance like cringes thing learned etc all of this because of a femcel correct term all of it the whole jist of the movie predicated on a angry pm omega level woman with the darkhold that want to be with her two imaginary son why the fuck doe it have to be those two those two kid are one of the worst child actor that i have seen even america chavez wa more likeable than those two that cringy ice cream song they both sang to wanda made me want to strangle them also if she wanted kid so bad why not get a man superhuman or mutant preferred to fuck her and pump them out or doe she have a wilted womb like black widow this i think is the first horror like mcu movie that we ve seen it wanted to try to go for a sort of jump scare factor but to a much lighter degree but had the element of horror to it in certain circumstance ie wanda possessed chasing strange chavez and christine palmer through the tunnel where she stop destroying one of the last door the three turn around stupidly instead of keep on running to wonder why she didn t destroy the door only for her to appear before them from the other out of nowhere two mom for america chavez were the only lgbt reference she got scared by a bee and teleported them away including herself to other universe and are assumed dead we ll never know of their true fate no tom cruise superior iron man sadly a shame dreamwalking is one of the power that the darkhold provides to allow possession of other version of yourself from the multiverse illuminati looked powerful on paper but super weak against the scarlet witch it is the first time i think that we ve seen super hero being brutally torn up like that on the big screen i mean you got black bolt s mouth sealed then his skull crushed captain america what if version sliced in half by the waistline with her own bloody shield captain marvel crushed by her own statue which is strange to die from considering her cosmic power level professor x avier getting his neck snapped which is also strange considering his telekinesis power level and mister fantastic reed richards with genius level intellect getting turned into shredded paper we didn t even get to see fantastic use any of his power to any extent sorcerer supreme baron mardo on the other hand wa busy with our universe strange eye of agamotto on strange s forehead near the end of the movie and mid credit along with charlize theron clea the third eye give strange a sort of magically enhanced sight it s a revealer of truth that can reenact recent event and see into the soul of others most likely awakened by the use of the darkhold i liked the musical note mystic art fight with sinister strange in the universe corrupted by the darkhold they were really throwing the mozart out there all this talk of the book of the vishanti and we never ever get to see it used once they really need some magic to protect book containing supremely powerful magic from just getting burned for christ sake http www marvel com article comic what is book of the vishanti in the comic http www marvel com article comic what is book of the vishanti in the comic clea eventual sorcerer supreme of the dark dimension a cousin of dormammu the one that strange tortured when he wa trapped in the dark dimension to let him escape she s basically a demi god half mortal half pure magical being http youtu be lrhtr pihw http youtu be lrhtr pihw it is my assumption the next strange movie will involve dormammu invading earth clea helping strange which would get her imprisoned by dormammu puppet baron mardo being the arch nemesis of strange before being joined by dormammu with the eventual win for strange on that movie if they go by the comic it may even be the first time they ll show a cosmic entity like eternity more powerful than the celestials that created the eternals to deal with dormammu eventually the only safe place for clea would be earth where she ll lose her magic then study in the sanctum sanctorum to find a way to regain them strange will later become sorcerer supreme and take her on a a disciple where they ll grow close and later she ll become clea strange fuck christine palmer she is one loyal woman i can tell you that basically a keeper of hotness rare these day the necronomicon from the evil dead is more or le like the darkhold hence why we see a cameo by bruce campbell the hotdog or meatball stand owner that strange used mystic art on to have him keep hitting himself in the face until post credit hope they didn t officially kill wanda off i mean she s gone through a lot of trauma and all that but she is still one of the most powerful marvel character out there with more emotion than captain marvel herself sure she fucked up twice but she eventually found herself again in the end and burned all the darkhold s throughout the multiverse not sure how she managed that she didn t need to crush herself in the darkhold castle

what do none muslim and not pakistani think about the m marvel show to preface this i am a muslim pakistani i am also i just watched the episode and it had lot of reference to pakistani culture and islam that i think would go over the western audience head surprising there wa also a decent amount of urdu spoken by the character my question is are none pakistani muslim enjoying the show it feel like it s targeting a specific niche and to be honest the representation is good but not great so far some stuff is over exaggerated although admittedly a lot of it is close to reality and is decently relatable to a yr old pakistani boy i just don t see how western audience would enjoy the show but please tell me otherwise
how professor smart hulk could be used differently in the mcu i think we all know by now marvel the majority of the fan base don t quite like how the feige ha been using the hulk i have an idea to make him more interesting then ever before banner being smart hulk for so long is allowing hulk s consciousness to grow and learn thing like a normal person but rather then a raging monster they ll have to figure how to write it until he s smart enough to switch with banner and became a hulk who s not only the strongest but now one of the smartest intellect on earth he would be a great villain imo
unpopular opinion on thor everyone is crapping on it for being so comical but i found the funnier scene more entertaining than the serious one the serious scene just made me anticipate the funny one more and the funnier scene had more energy and vibrant eye catching imagery the humor wa this movie strength and this is a cruel unfunny world we live in some humor in an action packed superhero movie is good nowadays

weirdworld vol so i ve been reading some pretty random stuff on marvel unlimited and just finished this issue little run it wa an ok story and character but the ending seem kind of like a cliffhanger and from what i ve been able to gather it wa never continued in any way the character seem to make one cameo appearance in champion but that is it anyone know if there wa any conclusion to this or continue in anyway
i just got a idea for a story wolverine in asgard so i ve been thinking about how logan s healing factor prevents him from aging and sadly outliving alot of his loved one and then i remembered how thor and the other asgardians have really long lifespan themselves so i thought what if at some point logan move in with the asgardians i don t know about about you but the image of wolverine fighting alongside asgardians against other norse mythological creature sound amazing and hey maybe logan can have a romance with valkrie the comic one not the mcu one now doe this sound like it could be a good story or is it just some fanfiction nonsense go easy on me please
d is good and scarlet witch is definitely the best part this is a pretty good movie and don t get me wrong doctor strange is badass america chavez is certainly ok not incredibly great but i consider her necessary for this movie but scarlet witch is even more badass than strange she s just a terrific character and a villain absolutely best represented in this movie and raimi wa the best director for this movie because he brought out that horror vibe in her quite a bit she s easily one of the best villain in the mcu maybe top five perhaps there really aren t that many super memorable and great villain in this franchise there is thanos obviously green goblin kilgrave fisk jigsaw scarlet witch of course ego i guess there are more standout villain than i thought but that still isn t very many given how much mcu content there is anyway this movie is similar to tdk i think both are badass movie but they are the kind of movie you d watch for the villain mostly the hero being secondary but given the story that s fine by me

issue by issue list of the green lantern by geoff john omnibus just a the title say can anyone give me the issue by issue list of the issue collected in green lantern by geoff john omnibus
green lantern beware my power spoiler ahead maybe the movie wa okay it s carried a lot by it animation like of all the new dcamu movie this one ha the best fight scene in my opinion i loved the reference to the jlu universe by the inclusion of both shayera and mari green arrow also seems to be the best part of the movie the inclusion of adam strange wa interesting and i m going to go read strange adventure a he never really had an impact on young justice but that s pretty much where my praise end how much you enjoy this movie is based on whichever green lantern you grew up with that is to say i grew up with john so my feeling about the movie are much on a lighter side also your comic book knowledge also applies to whether or not you will enjoy this movie the voice acting especially on the part of aldis a john is rather stiff like in some part it felt like they were righting john stewart to be slow khary payton or even brandon michael hall from the injustice game would have been a better pick in my opinion also a much a i love nolan north his voice hal jordan or i m too used to him a the ghost from destiny or superboy from young justice so really that could be a me issue and shouldn t be taken to heart in the review he also ha the best performance in the movie others who watched the movie complained about boring sound effect but really that didn t bother me but it s the impact of some scene that are kinda stiff for example there s a kamikaze scene in the movie that just happens like i m sitting there shocked while for the character it just happens also they don t even try to stop they just watch it happen all so it get boring in some part but all in all okay movie p back to what i said about whichever lantern you grew up with matter to how you enjoy the movie there s a scene where if you re a fan of hal i warn tk go in with an open mind

how would batman react to this i m writing a fanfiction of dc with my character having the grace of lucifer from supernatural my mc let s call him sam for now sam is a muslim he wa just praying until he after prayer blacked out and found himself in a garbage bin with a energy inside of him he couldn t possibly comprehend it whispered to him that it could do so much for him a long a he asked and well he did he always wanted a white suit and a healthier body which it gave him he thought this wa a dream cause he heard about people having lucid dream though he never experienced one himself a he walked through an alley he heard sound of struggle and saw a man assaulting a woman he saw the injustice and wanted to stop it the power inside him told him he just needed to say the word though a he wa about to a man in a bat suit crashed down from the sky and beat the man up sam wa perplexed this dream wa getting weirder and weirder wa that really batman he walked closer and a he did he wanted to know who the man wa and why he wa doing this his power a such brushed against the mind of the criminal and saw that he had committed many crime such a murder theft r p slave trafficking for the penguin and that this wa the second time he escaped from prison and a he saw all that he wa disgusted he wa quite a religious person and wa taught right and wrong from his parent wa taught by them to be forgiving but not silent in the face of oppression and injustice he knew batman would just throw him back into prison with a couple of broken bone and wa not satisfied with that he wanted the man to be punished and the power whispered again that he only needed to say the word and so he did bleed he whispered and a he did the criminal started to bleed from his ear and eye he wa squaling like a pig until he exploded and the bat saw all of it this is of course a rough draft i will go more in detail when i write the real thing but i am interested in with batman would do after this would he call the justice league talk sam down and if if doesn t work go against him would batman be in the right going against him i m interested in hearing your thought also so that i don t blaspheme i ll just say that all these power aren t real and only god ha the power to do all this btw already thanks for whoever answer appreciate it

advice on what to read after long hiatus i wa really into dc comic around the mid s era pretty much for the duration of infinite crisis and one year later i m curious about getting back into dc but not sure where to start to get my footing with whatever is currently canon in the universe any major storyline between then and now that i should check out or anything that s really consequential to the state of the dc universe
imo it would be great if a new dc movie universe started based on the batman i can never go back and watch the dceu movie because of how slopilly they were made the mcu built up to it s avenger level threat by making movie of the main member of the avenger but dc had one mid superman movie and a civil war event and boom justice league i wish that they make individual movie of character in the pattinson verse like how the cw is the arrow verse in a timeline like the batman green arrow with stephen amell coz he deserves more love superman red white and blue son for confussion s sake wonder woman the return of gal gadot the batman with brayn cranston a mr freeze and aaron paul a mr freeze green lantern the return of ryan reynolds from harold and kumar the flash with grant gustin coz fuck ezra miller the justice league introduce cyborg in a teen titan movie coz he more titan than leaguer for me a big avenger level threat need build up and i think putting out movie after movie based on individual character is a great way to create a universe i could see them adapting the first season of arrow into a green arrow movie and wonder woman should continue to be played by gal gadot coz i love her i also really wanna see an adaptation of justice league doom so robert pattinson can say then you re all damn fool to the jl member at the end of the movie

re watching avenger infinity war endgame question thanks to covid i had the opportunity for an infinity saga rewatch watching them back to back there were a couple of weird plot hole that seem like inconsistency but i m guessing were just deleted scene that were never explained doe anyone know the answer to these amp x b in infinity war after thor make stormbreaker thor groot rocket are teleported to wakanda in the middle of the battle via the bifrost however at the beginning of the movie heimdall is killed and us the bifrost sword one last time to teleport hulk back to earth to warn the avenger if heimdall is dead and the bifrost sword is still on the ship in space how did they teleport thor clearly didn t have it a he had to travel via space ship to nidavellir in endgame valkyrie and a decent chunk of asgardians are on earth how did they get there when the asgardians were shown a killed by thanos in infinity war at the end of guardian of the galaxy there s a big deal made of the guardian saving xandar amp giving the power stone to the nova corp for safekeeping even going so far a to show john c reilly s character reuniting with his wife and kid then xandar is destroyed off panel in infinity war meaning it s sort of the guardian s fault that they left the infinity gem there is this ever touched on maybe something for guardian how come the rat that free scott lang from the quantum realm doesn t get any cred that rat is single handedly responsible for defeating thanos otherwise scott would be trapped in the quantum realm forever and there would be no endgame

how could ve injustice been avoided if the justice league simply requested to the u government that a bill law be passed which will allow certain inmate to be punished by the death penalty instead of being allowed to live under insanity this law would distinguish a person who ha time exhibited the ability to actively break containment and murder with or without regard for the loss of sentient life will be legible to stand trial for law xyz in conclusion criminal like the joker and the penguin can finally face justice however criminal and super villain who through psychological diagnosis are proven to have been manipulated into their circumstance should receive something different a we know gt harley quinn wa able to turn her life around lt what other thing could or should be implemented to prevent the constant cycle of tragedy and loss of life

imo iron man and spider man have a somewhat toxic relationship in the mcu i have multiple reason a to why i think this when they first met in civil war peter is starstruck at meeting his hero and tony take him to his room to have a chat on him being spider man and needing his help peter didn t want to go until tony decided to blackmail him by telling his aunt may everything if he didn t come forcing him to go to protect his identity he is then bribed with a fancy hotel room and a new suit for peter to use in the fight clouding peter s judgment on the whole thing i m assuming he didn t really tell peter the whole story with the accord which go against many thing spider man is and only that captain america went rogue so bringing peter a literal fourteen year old into a battle between the avenger isn t something any sane adult would do even if they are stronger than most of the hero there onto homecoming peter is dropped off back at his apartment where two month go by with both happy and tony ignoring him during that time peter wa doing his spider man gig like always until he discovered the vulture and his alien tech is rescued by iron man from drowning and the two have a talk on peter taking on this guy tony say this kind of stuff wa below their pay grade which is something spider man would never excuse after uncle ben he also happens to mention the voice mail peter leaf them so he ha the time to listen to whatever peter sends but can t send any kind of reply back it s then shown tony isn t in the suit but somewhere else at a fancy gathering and not much worried about the vulture situation fast forward sometime and ned hack into the multimillion dollar suit built by tony stark himself allowing peter to use all kind of feature he didn t know about one of those feature happen to be an instant kill mode why would tony give a teenager an easier way to kill someone and an easy way for them to hack to use it later spider man is at the ferry putting a stop to a weapon deal of vulture when the fbi get a jump on him and the criminal allowing adrian to run off to suit up ferry get sliced in half and iron man come to save the day he then meet peter again blaming him for the whole incident and telling him he wa the one that put the fbi on it telling peter everyone thought he wa crazy bringing in a fourteen year old to fight firstly peter can t be fully blamed for this a tony failed to inform him the fbi would be involved secondly why would tony involve the fbi there s no way they were trained to deal with criminal using alien tech because vulture is the one to capitalize on it peter wa much more aware on what kind of danger he wa facing and almost took down the operation if the fbi didn t intervene thirdly did tony tell other people who spider man is we know happy and pepper did but who else who else in higher power can put peter in danger if his secret got out tony then want the suit back with peter saying he wa nothing without it having the idea forced in his head he wouldn t be good enough because of tony he wa already spider man for six month before he met tony and two month with the the suit which wasn t any much different from his old one till he hacked it he wa spider man not tony to rub in some salt he make peter walk home in dirty pajama from a garage bin or else he would have had to journey home in his underwear couldn t have used some of your billion of dollar to by some decent clothes for him to go home in peter feel like crap and blame himself because his hero dumped all the guilt onto him at the end peter is picking up by happy who admitted his wrong doings and forever grateful to peter finally giving him respect he should ve given in the first place tony take some credit in peter taking down the vulture saying it wa a good lesson for him wa the lesson that he didn t need your suit to stop him tony then bribe him again with a better suit similar to his and a spot on the avenger which that make him have to sign the accord ha tony been breaking the law still by ignoring the accord for spider man thankfully he reject wanting to focus on the little a he lost sight of that to focused on becoming an avenger with his hero he go home to find the suit in a bag on his bed tony still somewhat bribing peter and did he break into his home to put it there between the event of homecoming and infinity war i honestly don t think peter and tony hung out a much a people think only really check ups and special occasion like the photo of them in endgame now far from home peter is very reliant on stark tech and doesn t seem to fully trust his ability to use them a much when he meet fury he s given a pair of glass that belonged to tony when he put them on later he learns how powerful they were when scanning people s phone and accidentally sending a drone strike on a classmate why the hell would tony give these to a teenager why not rhodey pepper or hell happy these glass are almost an exact copy of ultron and if they exist why didn t tony use them during endgame mysterio later get the glass after manipulating peter and we see the destruction and horror they can bring it didn t help when everyone expected petee to become the next iron man when he s been doing his own thing for a while that s it that s my full opinion on the whole mentor weird dad thing iron man and spider man been doing it saddens me when fan say tony is like a father to peter when they forget it wa ben parker who with may took in and raised peter the one who s responsible for peter being the great hero he is
my theory for mcu secret war now a we all know phase is coming to an end and papa fiege ha been cooking up something a they say in wandavision really good in all seriousness he ha even stated that he ha been teasing for the past few movie and if we look really closely the only thing there to connect the dot is kang the conqueror and the multiverse so i have a theory that will bring some unexpected surprise secret war host in the past now in the past there have been been many host for the event known a secret war an event where a villain us his ability to merge the multiverse together and have hero and villain battle to the death for a piece of land in most universe for example earth main universe earth secret war year later earth doom kept beyonder s power earth x men and spider man cartoon and earth the host of secret war ha been the beyonder in other universe such a earth earth and earth doctor doom ha been the host of secret war in marvel s most recent animated series for kid battleworld basically an animated show all about secret war aka earth trn thanos and loki were the host of secret war however a you ve seen so far a for powerful being causing secret war one of the most powerful is missing from the list that villain being kang the conqueror my theory being that we already saw a glimpse of kang in loki due to both his variant hewhoremains and his statue in the alternate tva along with the fact that we are going to see him along with m o d o k in ant man and the wasp quantumania i have a theory that ant man is going to accidentally free mr richards not reed for you idiot who aren t paying attention from wherever he is in the quantum realm and in doing so kang will start secret war while this would be a first for kang it certainly wouldn t be much of a surprise like if thanos can do it in a cartoon centered for kid then you bet your boot kang can do it in a movie meant for teenager and adult now how would kang go about doing this you ask well most of the time for example comic and tv show kang s plan center around time travel or a marvel rule call it alternate universe creation in the lego marvel universe kang used a device that he had put on world he had been time universe traveling to and merged the universe into one creating a sort of secret war but it wa never officially called that but maybe kang could do so again in the mcu this time but this time to create an official secret war people that i believe would show up in this secret war okay so now we ve got our story ant man made another foolish mistake and set kang who wa trapped in the quantum realm free and he ha now created secret war now we have to figure out who other than the people of earth comic earth movie would show up well let s see we saw a whole bunch of alternate universe character from endgame like the and others we also have all those loki from loki or even the what if character heck everyone would love to toby maguire and andrew garfield again no question maybe we d finally get a live action version of the character from spiderverse and with how thing are going maybe character like venom morbius it s morbin time vulture and others could show up and fight spider man since everyone ha that theory heck we could possibly even finally meet ssu spider man in secret war though i sincerely doubt we ll see him in secret war before we see him in the ssu

convince me otherwise jason todd should be the next batman before i start i want to get the big elephant out of the room asap i don t have a problem with jace fox s batman nor do i have a problem with there being a black batman there already were throughout the multiverse for year dc ha moved jace to ny so i m talking about a batman for gotham now that that s out of the way let me explain my reasoning why first off this is more of a hypothetical if bruce didn t return after dark crisis or if bruce decided his justice league duty needed to come first or any other reason for bruce s absence happened next we list out all the potential folk who have properly earned the right to take up the mantle next and look into each nightwing dick grayson red robin tim drake robin damian wayne red hood jason todd nightwing the obvious first choice a without bruce being counted ha literally been batman more than the others the problem though lie with motivation character and legacy dick ha never been motivated to take over a batman from bruce halfway through being robin he knew he didn t want to his character doesn t fit with batman either it s akin to casting a charismatic actor in a role a an unfeeling emotionless character nightwings whole thing is cracking joke and lightening the mood even with bullet flying over his head then there s legacy the nightwing hero moniker is one of the rare legacy character that folk who aren t hugely familiar with dc have still heard of or know of he s earned the right to be a known a any dc character over the year red robin best detective of the bunch and a whizz at tech but drake ha seen what kind of batman he could become thanks to jor el ever since then he s been adamant to distance himself from becoming batman a much a possible even changing his hero name to drake at one point which luckily dc had the sense to even mock recently he just doesn t want it robin damien wayne started out a an annoying brat everyone wanted to die but by the time he did die he wa one of the most interesting character in the batfamily and everyone wanted him back i honestly think he d make a great batman in the future but he s just too young i think the comic have him at age right now so he literally couldn t be a bat man yet red hood the original brat everyone hated and wanted dead and then they goy to vote on it and he did but when he returned a red hood it not only gave u a great story but a great new complex character to find out about villain to anti hero to hero back to anti hero jason s been thrown around dc a lot over the year simply because he ha no direction it s because of everything above that i think he d make a great batman with some fantastic story idea him and bruce are at each others throat every weekend yet in an emergency he always show up a long a he can the way i imagined it is bruce ha left video message for each batfamily member jason s is the last and although it start off with bruce lecturing him about killing and gun it turn into a challenge bruce explains that when jason returned he told bruce he could clean up gotham better than him bruce challenge jason to do this a batman no gun no killing you wanted to prove you could clean up gotham better so be better this is your one and only chance to finally prove you meant what you said and to harness that darkness i know is inside you a it wa with me and use it to make every street thug monster and villain fear the name batman again jason would make mistake realise he had a lot of assumption about being batman that are being proven incorrect with every single day realise that bruce never truly did this on his own with alfred and the robin around and so push himself to ask the batfamily for help most of all he d struggle with defining justice a his previous alterego preferred killing rather than looking to rehabilitate there lot of batman story that could be told with jason under the cowl that just couldn t be told with bruce jason know living on the street he can eventually sympathise and empathise looking for feedback though anyone have any reason why jason wouldn t fit

i really hope after thor love and thunder writer and director will try to put more quality into their movie and le joke spoiler free i loved the movie i read the comic about gorr and the mighty thor the day they were released so i really anticipated this movie the concept and the build up wa amazing every scene with gorr in it wa amazing and frightful at the same time i will say it gorr s build up and execution a a charavter portrayed by christan bale wa phenomenal the best villain of mcu so far but every other scene in the movie with the slightest of fun joke and frivolous approach did no good to the movie but harmed it why is it so difficult to create a movie in mcu where people try to act somewhat serious in most of the time it s not jut child who watch the movie and even they can accept if the stake are extremely high just look at infinity war and endgame movie were high rated for numerous reason for a reason and it s not the blatant forced humor and joke that make the movie look worse than what it is i had the same feeling with multiverse of madness tony stark wa the snarky figure who always shot joke on point and this type of personality isn t exactly fittting for dr strange but luckily it wasn t a much a it wa in thor yet the movie wa still weak and mostly wa carried by the fantastic elizabeth olsen who played her role extremely well and the ymanaged to make her really terrific the same go for love and thunder when you see gorr you are watching an amazing movie natalie portman s role wa also great but they could have used her better le childish and more serious after knowing what is goin on with her i do not want to complain because the movie wa fine it wasn t bad but for fuck sake please reduce the amount humor and joke and childish element you out into these movie it well help if you keep humor and joke on level and don t let it to ruin the movie

dark crisis spoiler not really spoiler but it ha some spoiler just some my opinion about the issue i remember when williamson said that dark crisis would be a wild ride to the titan fan and u know i thought oh something will happen to them but after all it s just because he decided to destroy the tower put slade defeating them killing character and all of that without them having any line besides nightwing ofc he is dc s favorite batboy lol dc really hate the titan because there s no reason to nerf them just to make deathstroke win a battle when they could just have put deathstroke going to bludhaven to kill nightwing because slade literally say he s only interested in nightwing i wonder if that wa the original plan but the bat editorial didn t let it happen because it would break the tumblr life of nightwing in his current run anyway titan are never beating the crisis s punchbag allegation

the hulk in endgame is a great analogy for mental health and therapy i have seen lot of reference to mental health with other character but i have had this theory that one of the most important theme with mental health for this phase of marvel wa smart hulk we all know hulk is rage and in infinity war hulk didn t want to come out and this led to a battle with banner who then had to use one of the hulk buster suit to participate in the battle in endgame when we first saw smart hulk in the diner he say for year i ve been treating the hulk like he s some kind of disease something to get rid of but then i started looking at him a the cure eighteen month in the gamma lab i put the brain and the brawn together and now look at me best of both world this is important because now we have hulk s strength and banner intelligence at one time which wa imperative for the avenger success when it wa time for someone to snap their finger only hulk could do it and survive if hulk wa in his rage form without banner s mind he would not be able to cognitively control himself to bring everyone back we know from how stark died that no one else would be able to survive maybe thor but he wa dealing with his own grief and a stark said it s not just that that glove is channelling enough energy to light up a continent i m telling you you re in no condition i m currently watching that part a i type and you can even see banner hulk thinking about what he must do and what it could do to him for me this is the perfect analogy for mental health and therapy it is really difficult having a mental heal diagnosis we can t control and oftentimes feel like it control u but through therapy and spending some time getting to understand and know ourselves better we may be able to become a better version of ourselves like banner and hulk did in the gamma lab personally i wa diagnosed with ocd year ago while it suck to have intrusive thought and compulsion a good part of it is intense focus and almost becoming obsessed with thought or a goal or if i don t do this other thing will happen through therapy and lot of difficult epr i can focus that energy on really big goal while i work on not becoming obsessed with that goal i do feel i can use some extra mental processing and problem solving to overcome obstacle i have friend with other mental health challenge expressing similar sentiment after therapy or medication not at all speaking for everyone but it is always an interesting conversation and i have wanted to share this idea of hulk and therapy for a long time thanks for reading

read a little of jason aaron s thor and it wa great is thor usually a serious character if so i feel like that make the ragnarok movie even worse i hated the ragnarok movie for it crudeness and how it seemed to completely ignore thor s previous personality but i ve never been an expert of thor the issue i read recently were pretty serious in tone and from what i ve seen of thor from game and other medium it seems like he s usually a pretty serious character with maybe a few comic relief tendency here and there so comic book reader is this true for the most part is thor a more serious character

this month mark the seventh year i ve been collecting dc comic seven year ago this month i went to one of the comic shop in my town for the first time i wa year old and had been thoroughly amazed by the comic i had been reading in the graphic novel section of the library mostly batman for the past year there wa something about comic that i had never experienced in any entertainment medium before the cover were always flashy and promising but the story inside could be anything from brightly colored slugfest to moving story about larger than life character i loved all of it and wanted more so i looked for any nearby comic shop on the internet chose the smaller le ostentatious of the two in my town and asked my mom to drive me over to have a look when i walked in there wa a a whole rack of new comic that stretched about half the length of the store plus box and box of back issue from almost every era in comic history there were graphic novel too and paperback collection of series i had only read about online there were collector edition issue a well a some particularly valuable issue that were way out of my price range at the time and many still are beyond that there were plenty of other nerdy delight scattered throughout the shop trading card game tabletop rpgs badass collectible figurine and pretty much anything else one could ever want later i would briefly get into and regularly play magic the gathering at the shop the then mid year old man who run the place knew pretty much everything you could think of about all of it though a bit difficult to deal with at first he helped me understand the basic of the dc universe and where i should start if i wa truly interested in getting into comic this is right after convergence and the end of the new so to say i wa a little lost wa an understatement regardless i purchased my first new comic there detective comic the first issue of the second series to not be a part of the new looking back the storyline of that and the next few issue is god awful jim gordon replaces bruce a the police sanctioned batman for a time but at the time i didn t care i wa so excited to finally be part of something i had tentatively enjoyed for a while now i had the chance to throw myself into this medium and subculture for real and i definitely did year later i m working towards a college degree and generally being an adult but i still love and respect comic i still go to that same shop every week and the other store in town if i have extra money to pick up my pull list i started reading marvel comic too some year back but that s a story for a different time and subreddit i ve definitely changed in the last year and i actually partially credit comic for the good and the difficult during that time in the last year my worldview and understanding of life have changed drastically i wa born into a very conservative christian family i wa rarely exposed to other belief or way of life but i often got glimpse of the outside world through movie and video game comic however had arguably the biggest impact in my life there i wa exposed character of different religion race sexual orientation political view etc i remember reading batwoman elegy year ago it wa one of my first non hostile introduction to the idea that same sex relationship can be enjoyable i remember reading black lightning year one and realizing that i a white person could enjoy comic starring racially diverse character without feeling like i wa being replaced so yeah anyone who say comic shouldn t be diverse is well just wrong it can have a positive effect on reader like me similarly during high school my mental state fell to piece i had no real support from friend or family and therapy or medicine wa hard to come by but i still had comic i got to read story of imperfect hero who often had fragile mental and emotional life but were still able to do superhuman task for the benefit of others it gave me hope and a sense of self that i desperately needed the idea of turning to a favored entertainment medium for support during rough time is often seen a a cliche or worse labeled a escapism but for those really suffering having something to enjoy with no string attached just good story and iconic character can literally be a saving grace i won t be overly dramatic and claim that comic changed my life but they have been a constant source of enjoyment imagination and progress for almost a decade now i ve changed and so have comic but my enjoyment of them ha remained constant i love them now a much if not more than i did in seventh grade when i got the first comic i could call my own and i try to share that love with other people when i can i have a friend who sometimes accompanies me on my comic trip and listens to my moaning about the bat cat wedding that never wa seriously fuck tom king for that i also bring up comic whenever i see someone wearing a piece of clothing with one of my favorite character you never know when somebody wearing a batman logo can end up talking about classic comic for minute with you it s happened more than once all of this to say though i may bitch about dc s refusal to change their sacred status quo or allow batman to be happy i will never get over that wedding i love comic i love the character the story the theme and everything else they bring to the table thanks dc here s to another year and beyond

why did they make the modern superman a cheap rip off of the original superman the modern superman got written way more powerful and stronger than the classic superman just a an excuse to be a powerful a other company super hero the modern superman is not actually the original superman it a completely messed up version which got almost unlimited power with no reasoning behind just to keep him relevant on the marketing quite gross and unappealing that is why superman power feel artificial not credible even on it universe it is just absurdly badly written
a question about moon knight s jewish representation in the mcu i m going to start off by saying i loved moon knight and all the show and movie i m gonna mention in black panther a big part of the film wa exploring and referencing sub saharan african and black culture and it wa a big reason why it resonated so well with audience with m marvel ep we can see that a big part of the show is going to be revolving round pakistani and muslim culture and i love it i think it give her character depth so why then when marvel us it s jewish character do they re write them a white instead of jewish eg spiderman scarlet witch when moon knight wa announced i thought there s no way they can write all his root out and i wa right kind of they re wrote why he ha did not because of anti semitic attack not because he watched his synagogue burn down but because his mother beat him a a child they wrote out a big driving force of his character being a jew who serf an egyptian god the only real reference we got to his jewish root wa that his mother had a funeral and if you squint he can sometimes be seen wearing a star of david there wa that one scene when layla wa asked if she wa an egyptian superhero which by the way again loved it thought it fit the character perfectly a well a completing some form of arc about her relationship with egypt that summed the whole thing up perfectly why wasn t there a jewish moment like that why wa moon knight written to be solely an exploration of egypt and not be jewish the same way a m marvel or black panther or even egypt in moon knight why do jewish character always get whitewashed wa anyone else disappointed by this because i kind of feel robbed
teacher need help hello dc universe i am a teacher who us comic to keep student engaged i had success this past year implementing a story into my subject for example all year the student worked towards helping superheroes defeat villain exam over content and in defeating the villain student test score averaged to be higher then villain hit point they gained an infinity stone to add to their gauntlet i know it wa marvel themed and what i know more about this is where i need help i am teaching a second subject and want to incorporate dc into the second subject i will admit i don t know dcu a well a the mcu question is there a storyline that i should look into that incorporates the justice league i would need it to have many villain or a theme that could be used i have a basic idea that a villain is crossing the world universe and threatening different location and the student will need to help the superhero s to save major location however is there a comic story arc that you may recommend that i can follow for the school year i am open to any bad guy and superheroes from the lesser known like blue beetle to the major hero like tge batman tia
is superman secret origin superman brainiac and superman world of new krypton all canon to each other i ve been reading a few superman comic lately by geoff john and art primarily by gary frank there is evidence to suggest they re all canon to each other within the comic themselves but superman brainiac is a series in action comic whilst world of new krypton and secret origin are their own i can t find the answer on google so i ve resorted to here also if they are canon with each other are there any other comic that are part of it i know superman brainiac and world of new krypton are probably canon considering world of new krypton pick up where superman brainiac left off

what all do i need to know before reading flashpoint i ve seen all of the arrowverse which doesn t really give you a good idea of the dc basic when i got into marvel comic i had already seen a good amount of the cartoon all of the anime and the entire mcu at the time plus all of the other sony and fox movie however i don t have much of an idea for dc i want to start with flashpoint and read all of new until now what could get me into it i wa thinking the dc animated movie universe a the blu ray would be collectible and they have more direct adaptation of popular story any other suggestion i ve seen the new batman movie played dc universe online and the arkham game and i used to watch ttg a well i thought i should clarify that the arrowverse wasn t the only thing i ve seen

what if the boy wa still part of the dc universe i dunno about you guy but the boy on amazon prime is blowing up right now and recently eric kripke announced that the newest herogasm episode will reach xxx level of fanservice compared to dc s tv track record where arrow dwindled out of popularity supergirl titan and batwoman failed and the flash is now on the run from the cop with a kidnapped child well doing much better so imagine my surprise when i learn that the boy first six issue were published by wildstorm under dc comic before the higher ups said alright no more edgy s amp t like this and booted it out of their lineup but what if dc kept the boy what if even dc embraced the boy and made it into part of new an alternative earth xxx where the justice league never existed and were replaced with the seven even worse than earth x like i can see it already the boy finding themselves on prime earth going on a kill the justice league crusade believing them to be a corrupt a the seven it would be dc s main edgy series to compete against marvel s edgy series the x men hell maybe they could even have had a suicide squad x boy crossover where billy butcher proceeds to crowbar the living madness out of harley quinn but then against that s just my cent what do you dc people think would the boy have just tanked when dc announced the new and is better off without dc

including other mcu character in a main super hero film ruin the movie spoiler the one main and little concern that i have with the mcu franchise and with all the movie is when each of the film title with these super hero movie that are specifically supposed to be about their own story amp background had to include other cameo appearance of other mcu character outside of the respective marvel super hero s property for instance the spider man homecoming movie which included ironman spider man no way home including dr strange and recently thor love and thunder including a cameo appearance with guardian of the galaxy i know and understand that they are all connected together in the same marvel universe but i think the writer need to tone it down a notch or else it would diminish the main focus and the spot light of the super hero and would then be overshadowed by another mcu super hero that ha no relevance to the plot

doe civil war ever address cap s hypocrisy i ve been reading the civil war tie in and the anti registration side is given more than their fair share of the comic one thing that never seems to be addressed though is that cap is defending vigilante justice he want to break the law so hundred of other people can break the law i know nypd seems to be more lenient with superheroes otherwise you d have no comic but superheroes are barely active across the u in the marvel universe iirc nothing about vigilante justice seems to he codified in the law what civil liberty is cap trying to protect i have to be missing something because neither side address vigilantism and all the moral and legal quandary that come with it

an honest review of love amp thunder spoiler too much comedy in the movie thor love and thunder just like ragnarok i found to be full of bad comedy that not even a year old would laugh at there wa perhaps or decent joke in there the comedy expertise of taika waititi is doing the thor character more damage than good by turning him back into the moron he wa at the beginning of thor in thor there wa an interesting and serious arc where thor went from a proud and idiotic prince to a much more sensible and caring hero recent movie have turned thor into at best a moron and at worst a joke visuals thor in my opinion also had better presentation than ragnarok the visuals of asgard in the opening of thor were brilliant and truly portrayed asgard a a realm of god and hero while ragnarok simply lack the awe inspiring golden glory of asgard and make it seem more like just another cool planet recent movie have not done thor any favor it wa clear that kenneth branagh had a much more vivid picture of asgard and he wa able to very beautifully translate that picture into film love and thunder wa pretty similar to ragnarok in this way a few thor like visuals of omnipotent city would have been quite alluring although the few that we did see were pretty beautiful the visuals of new asgard were perfect also creating a perfectly appropriate earth asgard mix the visual of valhalla in the post credit scene wa utterly beautiful and didn t have the flashiness of asgard presenting it a the perfect resting place for god this humble yet glorious image of valhalla made it an immediately recognisable heavenly realm that the viewer felt at ease in portrayal of the greek god zeus wa not presented too great or too poorly his behaviour wa very much in line with the zeus of mythology and i wa very pleased with his showy and selfish attitude drawing a clear difference between the greek and norse god the accent wa quite bad making him sound strangely italian ish rather than greek i think there wa an attempt to give him a greek accent but they should ve taken the asgardian route and given him a british or american accent instead a it would ve sounded le broken and more realistic i loved the glimpse of dionysus whose costume made it immediately obvious who he wa the woman around zeus also helped to show off zeus personality and despite not having speaking role they had an important part to play in zeus scene gorr s portrayal one great point of the movie wa gorr s portrayal christian bale presented the character very well and gorr s humour wa most powerful a he wa so dark and terrifying especially in the scene where he killed the snake his more emotional moment with his daughter felt so real and made me actually like him although i m not a fan of what the movie did with love at the end many prop to christian bale and india rose hemsworth who played love yes she is chris hemsworth s daughter in real life for their acting in this movie the use of jane while the post credit scene set up jane s eventual return a a valkyrie i think the mighty thor wa an interesting character a her weakness in her mortal form gave her a perfect reason to keep wielding mjolnir i would have preferred to keep the character for a few movie before killing her off a her arc in this movie felt too rushed towards her death but her death gave u that amazing visual of heimdall and valhalla so i really can t complain conclusion a lot of the acting in this movie wa magnificent and the movie had a few beautiful visuals that managed to make up for some of the more lackluster visuals we were given in ragnarok bale especially stood out and it is a shame we won t get to see more of him in the mcu i loved him in the dark knight trilogy and it is good to see that ten year later bale still ha what it take to make a superhero movie amazing in my opinion taika waititi specialises in comedy and his intentionally funny movie are absolutely amazing but the thor character wa not supposed to be funny therefore i feel that he wa the wrong choice for this movie franchise and that marvel either need to tone down the comedy or bring back kenneth branagh the excessive attempt at comedy continued from ragnarok and did make the movie a bit le enjoyable breaking up the flow of seriousness with thing like the screaming goat and the i want to feel shitty about you line the latter being said a if he wa a kid trying to confess to his first crush even though he already know jane extremely well but overall a pretty good movie i don t think it stand on a par with multiverse of madness but it is one of the best movie i have seen by general standard and therefore wa quite enjoyable there are a few improvement i hope to see in thor s next movie but nothing too major

disney plus show besides what if judged based on how likely it would be for another mcu character to show up i mean some of these are pretty tight all thing considered but others are le well put together wandavision likelihood very low most likely to get involved falcon war machine dr strange wang gt this is a massive crisis but it s a massive crisis in podunk nowhere quickly taken over by sword the only character that would even know about it are character that had high level military clearance and character who could innately sense that stuff happening if dr strange didn t smell it falcon and war machine don t exactly have a record of getting involved in sketchy government group so they re probably not the top of the trust list i put wang on there because dr strange is unknown wang is public information if you know where to look lt falcon and the winter soldier likelihood somewhat low most likely to get involved hulk gt in this case the issue wasn t a major catastrophic threat just a small group of people with the super soldier serum the only character that should be really concerned is the guy who got a bad dose of it and turned into a monster this isn t public information though so it s unlikely that this is going to have a major impact lt loki likelihood very low most likely to get involved the eternals gt the eternals go a far back a human society so there s no point in time for the tva to go that the eternals haven t been and if you convince them that you re a threat once they re going to be there year later in the exact same physical condition ready to throw down they re also quite a bit tougher than loki so they re not easy to prune lt hawkeye likelihood incredibly high most likely to get involved spider man gt peter parker life two block from rockefeller center where the finale of hawkeye take place and it s not quiet there are gun firing the tree fall down a tree that s standing up in the final moment of no way home and kingpin get involved and in the comic kingpin and spiderman fight all the time lt moon knight likelihood fairy high most likely to get involved dr strange and wang gt the finale of moon knight take place in cairo which is a huge city this wouldn t be a quiet event it s just shot from an angle that make it seem like cairo is just an empty desert dr strange and wang conveniently both have the ability to teleport and the knowledge to say oh wow that s a bad magical thing let me help fight the giant alligator lt m marvel likelihood incredibly high most likely to get involved half of the mcu but especially dr strange wang and shang chi gt most of the mcu character live around the vicinity of new york since that s where marvel s office were when most of those character were created jersey city is minute away by car minute by foot if i m dr strange and i see a video of a girl on youtube shooting magic in a public convention i m going there to see what the heck is going on lt

top favorite character who are you top five favorite character and why processing img xg rf m vw wanda her evolution is fascinating from starting a a secondary antagonist in aou to her star turn a the scarlet witch no one ha been on such a wild journey a her her trauma is so severe although i didn t like what they did with her in mom she ll still be my favorite character no doubt what elizabeth olsen brings to role never fails to impress cap this is a man played beautifully by chris evans he became one of my favorite in tws because he s such a loyal friend and genuinely good person he quickly shot up to in civil war because i have major authority issue and cap s choice to flip off the govt here wa so satisfying he trust his judgement above all else and he s always correct in that cap is a man the ultimate man sersi speaking of the ultimate man i think sersi might be the ultimate woman despite only seeing her once sersi ha instantly become one of my favorite because her femininity is her ultimate strength her ability to transmute her surroundings feel like an allegory for her ability to heal the world which she essentially did dying to see her again gemma chan delivers on all front love her facial expression rocket love this furball bradley cooper s best performance layered funny but also deeply moving it s a cgi character and yet cooper s performance transcends that i m already mourning the potential loss of him one day should cooper decide to vacate the role cap wa given so much story but i don t know how i can feel satisfied with a rocket ending maybe if he got his own movie nebula much like rocket this poor woman ha been through too much choosing the wrong side would not have only been easier for her but also made much more sense given where she wa in life initially and yet she zigged when the universe might have expected her to zag she s introverted but you can tell she craves connection and karen gillan just doe a wonderful job

doctor strange multiverse of madness this movie wa so promising until i actually watched it the plot itself is really annoying with one of the most boring character in america wanda being this vengeful over being separated from her child there s no justifiable action to murder hundred of people also the incredibly cringe woman on woman action scene made my face twitch apparently the captain america equivalent in peggy carter is somehow stronger than charles xavier who would beat captain america in about second also had some very awkward writing for example when america can somehow now control her power and she say oh yeah to wanda yuck i wa pumped for this movie but woke disney continues to ruin great storyline

theory about the sentry i have been thinking lately about the sentry and how his power work and i came up with a theory it is based on the origin of him taking the super soldier serum being fake a sentry is a reality warper so his origin could be what ever he belief it is at any given time so i extened that concept so the theory i have is that the world of marvel is the way it is cuz of the sentry a he want to play hero and save the day right so what better way to play hero than to have a world full of hero and villain to go on fantastical adventure with and save the multiverse so his power make it so a sentry ha next to no control of his reailty warping power so my theory is a possibility at least so what do you guy think could my theory hold some water or ha it already be disproven some how any feedback is welcome

is the boy really better than marvel tldr marvel is in dire need of mature content i ve been seeing quite a bit of discussion around this particular topic of late i personally think the marvel multiverse a a whole is better but i can absolutely see why people would prefer the boy over marvel in fact i ll go a far a to say that the boy season one through three are better than most marvel content of course which is better is simply opinion and there is no wrong answer however one thing i think we can all agree on is that the boy highlight a massive problem in the mcu no real mature content they did a damn fine job of making it work for phase and i commend them for that however those of u that have been around since the first iron man in are now in our s and s we simply don t want a strict limit of pg or pg we re grown as adult i get that they re trying to appeal to the younger generation to perpetuate the marvel brand but a a loyal fan i m feeling a bit abandoned i m not saying everything marvel ha to be r rated but please throw u a friggin bone marvel this problem is only going to get worse a time go on deadpool remaining r rated for the next sequel is great but it s not enough

idea for a hulk and she hulk cartoon the pilot is basically she hulk s origin it would be pretty much identical to the comic version except for the fact that jen resents bruce for turning her into a monster however after the leader lay a trap for the hulk that make shulkie go on a rampage hulk calm her down and jen apologizes to bruce for acting so horribly hulk offer to take the blame for all the destruction and she hulk immediately reject the idea then the army and iron man show up and want to detain the hulk they tell she hulk to stand aside but she refuse she stomp the ground hard causing a small earthquake and then hulk us a thunderclap to send iron man and the army flying hulk and she hulk escape and turn back into bruce and jen bruce asks why jen did that and jen say because they re family and she s not going to abandon family bruce brings up her law career and jen say she doesn t care about that anymore and say that he s more important than some dumb law career bruce start to protest again and jen envelops him in a tight hug she firmly say that she isn t going anywhere and that she owes him her life bruce smile for the first time he hadn t smiled once up until this point and say alright jen if that s what you want jen smile too and start walking into the sunset while saying come on we ve got a long road ahead of u with bruce following close behind her the entire show would be the adventure of hulk and she hulk on the run bruce would be voiced by neal mcdonough hulk would be voiced by fred tasticore and jen she hulk would be voiced by maria canal barrera guest star would include josh keaton a spider man brian bloom a captain america rick d wasserman a thor and benny grant a rick jones iron man will be sort of an antagonist and be voiced by nolan north other antagonist would be leader general ross abomination and titana betty ross would appear a a recurring character voiced by jennifer hale and would eventually turn into the red she hulk thought

so the mcu ha been doing a pretty bad job with the young avenger so far let s take kate bishop her dynamic with clint barton is one of the best in the comic they re equal sometimes kate is the adult in the room sometimes clint is they give each other shit like all best friend do etc in the mcu they turned kate into an annoying fangirl renner s own word btw a simpering wannabe sidekick and a total klutz for mostly unfunny comedic effect then there s america chavez in the comic she s a no nonsense powerhouse think diaz from b meet supergirl in the movie they made her a personality le damsel in distress that spends the entire film running from a fight and cowering behind doctor strange like a scared little girl elsewhere billy kaplan and tommy shepherd are still little kid and we only saw eli washington for second in the falcon and the winter soldier all in all not hopeful in the least about the mcu doing the young avenger right given their track record so far

exclusive variant cover going against pride initiative just a note before getting into my thought here i don t usually write these opinion based post and my point is not to sway anyone s opinion on sexuality so i apologize if i offend anyone in advance that is not my intention after seeing the th retailer exclusive variant cover for the poison ivy mini series that just came out earlier this month i started to get a sense of maybe how ironic it wa that we ve got all these pride based book promoting lgbtqia and the only pride based book getting retailer variant is poison ivy go to show where the market is at from a sexuality perspective i e heterosexual men with a secondary audience of anyone else who sexually prefers woman we didn t get any retailer variant for the pride collection nor the tim drake special that just came out this week and i d argue the story in each of those book were just a great to read to try to be mildly objective i wouldn t think poison ivy and harley quinn are more popular than the sum of all the character shown in the pride collection combined doe this suggest that the pride book don t sell or are retailer who pitch for exclusive not into the pride scene and even dare i say homophobic or is dc holding back on retailer making exclusive cover for pride based book this month with clear exception to poison ivy it just seems ironic that there s this big pride agenda from dc marvel other publisher and retailer don t seem to be making an effort to promote that retailer exclusive variant are usually an indication of which book are expected to sell at least based on the assumption that retailer have purposely invested in exclusive cover artwork to sell a unique version of the book so the decision to offer an exclusive cover is calculated to some degree

my new mcu multiverse theory a multiverse can be comprised of multiple subgroup just like a universe ha cluster and superclusters so the mcu s multiverse which a of now based on all confirmed connection includes the main earth earth all alternate timeline the dark dimension quantum realm nexus of all reality the cloud monster place from loki and all other plane of existence aside from universe sony spidey verse tobey mcguire and andrew garfield film with the alternate timeline for the villain earth and all onscreen universe such a all the one america and strange travel through rapidly notice i mentioned the dark dimension and quantum realm although i believe all universe in and out of this theoretical supercluster have those there is overlap with the comic multiverse a spider verse and spider geddon feature cameo from tobey and andrew but that doesn t completely invalidate this theory a we can just say superclusters aren t forbidden from interconnecting it s like an unofficial version of dc s multi multiverse

giant to take over the world said giant human begin terrorizing the countryside getting the attention of the daily planet who send both lois and clark clark however decides to ditch her and go a superman he fly over and see massive the massive human building home on a mountain meanwhile at the governor s mansion a giant break in and kidnaps both him and his daughter feel like he should have known about the giant superman attempt to sneak into the extinct volcano where the giant have made their home but a massive siren emits a message saying if he if wanted to continue his altruistic existence haha since when he should back off superman rebuff this but is attacked by one of the giant superman however fly down and break his toe causing the giant to hop around more giant come running so superman trigger an avalanche while everything is coming down one of the giant grab him and get buried under snow the scientist declares the death of superman come guy really right at the moment however lois is flying over in a plane get grabbed by one of the giant and kidnapped superman break out of the ice superman attempt to break into the lab but is caught by a giant once again the scientist offer to let superman join them but he rebuff them and they begin turning both lois and the governor s daughter into giant superman decides to heck with all of this escape the giant grab a big rock and slam it into the top of the volcano and set it off a all the glacier melt and the mountain flood the giant panic and try to run away crushing the scientist superman break back into the lab smash the glass between himself and the kidnapped woman and discovers that it wa a trick and the woman are fine he then grab everyone and fly away while the giant are buried and killed by the avalanche you know what kudos to superman i wa genuinely entertained by this comic and not just in an ironic way it s probably because these giant are the first real threat to superman since the comic began i know they re working their way up to giving him real villain and not just one he break into twig any time they anger him it wa nice to see hint of it and i look forward to seeing more it also help that this wa what i thought comic were going to be like before i started and not just you know superman being a menace to society by destroying metropolis and fighting the national guard and just to add on superman caused a volcano to erupt for corn s sake superman you have no idea how much damage that would cause it could mt st helen or krakatoa all over again but oh no let s just destroy a mountain to save three people god i love this man story clark is being spied upon through his apartment window but before he can deal with that an old friend who is connected with anti espionage service knock on his door he tell clark that a dangerous spy is coming to metropolis by boat and he want clark to investigate clark to decides to go a superman and fly to the port the spy sent to coordinate attack on the usa is named eric reibel come on guy for real he try to get his men to spread dangerous leaflet while striking a um notzi pose only for superman to break in and destroy the leaflet they try to beat him and you can bet how that go superman then grab a gun and shoot the reibel guy although he manages to jump in front of the bullet and stop it threatening that if he doesn t stop he ll let it hit him clark attempt to go meet his old friend but he hears a shot outside of his office i turn out the man that had been watching him wa his friend s assistant and ha killed his employer just a the cop arrive however the killer throw the gun to clark who catch it like an idiot and the assistant blame him they find in clark s pocket a list of the spy and saboteur and they arrest him clark escape and return a superman a start following reibel he and the spy end up in an isolated place in some mountain where superman discovers them gathering and training an army to attack the u there the leader who is not at all drawn like a stereotypical notzi say that the assistant that framed clark is now one of their agent in the anti espionage service naturally superman sneak into the tent and break into the safe to get the document a soldier try to bayonette him and superman wrap the gun around his body to tie him up awesome the whole camp is then scrambled where superman fight through men plane and artillery he then fly over their munition plant and contemplates not attacking it would kill everyone fortunately for that moral conundrum and the golden age kill count a stray shell whizz by him and suddenly forgetting he ha super speed he allows it to hit the munition plant and explode killing everyone turning back to clark he return to metropolis and kidnaps the assistant at gunpoint he take him back to the daily planet where he get the man to confess but lois point out that a coerced confession won t stand up clark however hand over the document from the notzi camp showing the assistant s involvement the man is arrested and all is well at least superman isn t fight the united state armed forced this time actual panel of action seem to be surprisingly rare in early superman all thing considered showing him causing wonton destruction to people he should be is actually quite satisfying i just hope he stick with the um uh notzis and not america then again he s already caused million of dollar worth of damage to america so why stop now also i didn t think they were ever going to address this but since lois brought it up yeah how do any of the confession superman get admissible and not under duress he basically take a criminal throw him around a bit and then threatens to kill them to get a confession anything they say to the police would be thrown out because superman threatened them to get it i wasn t going to say anything because you know comic book logic lol but they were the one to bring it up way to poke hole in your own mythology guy story clark ha taken lois to a carnival where they are actually having a good time one of the carnival barker however rope clark into playing a rigged game after a while clark try to quit but they force him to pay eight dollar playing the weenie clark pay and lois is disgusted lois decides to run an expose on those guy because i guess all the spy and giant are defeated so we need to go after carnival barker clark say not to do it but decides superman should handle these two bit huckster i guess lois catch proof but get caught and they destroy her camera she go to the owner of the carnival who act out firing the guy but secretly he s in on too the carnival worker later corner a guy who wouldn t pay up and start beating him but superman swoop in they try to stab him but superman take the knife and eats it that wa cool he beat them up and stick their head through one of those ball throwing board and then throw baseball at them like a psychopath he then toss them around dig underground around them and even decides to let them beat on him for a while lois show up and is grabbed by one of them superman decides he s had enough he then beat them up to get confession which the last comic established are inadmissible and lois get a policeman to arrest them upon realizing the jig is up the carnival owner attempt to flee but superman chase him down in his car by ripping open the canopy which is awesome and drag him back to the police he then show the cop that the owner ha been stealing valuable from people at the carnival the story end with superman telling the audience to always be on the lookout for unscrupulous character at place like carnival deep breath i m going to give this story a lot of latitude and say it wa meant to be a lesson for the kid not to waste their money at carnival game a sort of superman say segment where he try to teach all the youngster not to fall for these sort of thing otherwise i d explode at how much a massive step down we ve had in the level of crime that superman decides is worthy of his time he go from giant trying to destroy the world to a local two bit manure salesman making a couple dime off of idiot at the carnival it s for the kid for the kid teaching the kid don t lose it okay kid don t play those carnival game they re rigged let s move on
